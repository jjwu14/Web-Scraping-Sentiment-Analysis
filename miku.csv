It wasn't their fault but due to COVID restrictions, Bonnie Henry just announced no alcohol after 8:00pm so luckily we reserved our table at 7:00pm. We decided to go with the Waterfront Kaiseki for $88 which included 5 dishes. We started off with their hamachi crudo, chef's selection sashimi, baked saikyo miso sablefish, miku signature sushi selection and ended with their green tea opera. Everything was delicious and experience was top notch as always.As I've been here many times, the experience never gets old and the service is always a big reason why I come back. I will definitely come back when the restrictions get better as the waterfront view never disappoints!",3/16/2021,5 star rating
1,Colin W.,"San Francisco, United States","Hands down, the best place in town for high quality sushi / seafood and ambience / view. Despite COVID indoor dining restrictions, Miku has a beautiful wraparound patio that is heated and insulated from the wind by glass panes. Both raw and cooked seafood was fresh and delicious.Service was tremendous as well. We had some dairy dietary restrictions and the kitchen made replacements without compromising on taste!",4/19/2021,5 star rating
2,Katy E.,"Vancouver, BC","Expensive but great quality fish. They've reduced their prices in covid so it's worth a look if you usually rule it out for price, the lunch specials are great for a lunch if you can expense it.",9/23/2020,5 star rating
3,Melody T.,"Vancouver, BC","DELICIOUS AND FRESH! I always love Miku everytime I go! I love their sushi, desserts and refreshing drinks. Would recommend to drop by. Also the interior is pretty and has an open concept. You get greeted by the chefs and staff once you enter. The only think that was ok was the strawberry pistachio mousse cake. It had too much mousse. Tasted like a chunk of whip cream",4/3/2021,5 star rating
4,Celina H.,"Vancouver, BC","About 3 yrs ago, 5 of us were having dinner at Miku, one of the dish we've ordered was the Japanese imported I believe a Wagyu Steak in Vacuum pack... $290 - $295 That Steak came & it was over cooked & tasted like a Boring FLANK STEAL!!!I called the Manager & he didn't care, he did apologized as though I stepped on Poo at his restaurant!  Miku is just Trendy, food quality is good but expensive! Sashimi freshness is 7.5 out of 10! Vancouver has lots of good restaurants not great restaurants, as service goes?!? Do some traveling, just don't go to T.O. for food!

6,Joelle L.,"Burnaby, BC",Had the best dining experience at Miku! We got the Waterfront Kaiseki for 2 which was $88/person. So worth the price. The set menu came with 5 dishes that are surprisingly filling!!! Each dish was executed perfectly and took a total of almost 2.5 hours to finish. It was one of the best dinners I've had in a long time. Thank you Miku!,1/31/2021,5 star rating
7,Carmen H.,"Burnaby, BC","It was our first time trying Miku and we were super excited about it! Unfortunately, it was not what we expected. Either it's overhyped or our expectations were too high for Miku. Prices are definitely on the higher end; however, thanks to UberEats for 50% off coupons, we were able to try Miku at a feasible price. We ordered the Aburi Oshi and Roll Tier that consisted of 3 different types of Aburi Oshi (Salmon, Ebi, Saba), Red Wave Roll and the Miku Roll. We can definitely taste the fresh ingredients they've used (even real crab meat), but we wouldn't say it's high quality ingredients. The cut used in the Red Wave Roll was quite lean, making the salmon tough. The sauce on the Aburi Oshi's were delicious, but the texture wasn't like ""melt in your mouth"" type of Aburi. The sushi didn't fall apart when we picked it up, but the texture of the rice was quite dense and mushy (refer to the last photo). Based on the sushi we've had in Japan, you should be able to visually see the pieces of rice individually and it shouldn't have a overly sticky texture. Overall, it wasn't too bad. Our favourite roll from this platter would definitely be the ""Miku Roll"". However, we wouldn't pay full price for their sushi since we were expecting better quality for the price of it. Maybe we'll give it another try to confirm how we feel about the food.",12/30/2020,3 star rating

Warm, heater outside on the patio. I had a warm sushi platter set with miso and salad for only $43. It was a really warm, pleasant environment. I had a really relaxing lunch.

9,Melody W.,"Vancouver, BC","Came here for the $135 Miku Kaiseki menu.  Pre-covid times Miku was such a hopping place and it took planning to make a reservation.  Definitely not the case anymore as they only offered 2 seatings: 5pm and 8pm, but also some walk-ins as well.  We arrived at 7:25pm hoping to be seated earlier and it was fine.  Didn't have the expected level of service for dinner, took a while for the server to come by and he forgot what we ordered twice.  This being Miku you would probably expect your server to be extremely proficient and knowledgeable but this was not the case.  When asked about several sakes, we were told that one was....funky.  Probably not the best way to sell a sake, as funky could mean anything from bad armpit funky, or fermented rice good kinda funky.  Anyway, we did ask for a taste for both and decided to go with the ""funky"" one which I would describe as a more woodsy bamboo flavour and not too acidic and sweet.  Definitely not funky.The food itself was good, but the timing was way off.  We had to wait 10-15 min between each menu item which meant we sat there for 3 hours for the entire meal, and with a 8pm seating means you are not done until 11pm (and remember that alcohol cut off is now 10pm so you better anticipate what you want to pair your last few dishes with before the rude awakening!)The kaiseki set included:1. Snow crab sunomono - good!2. Ume Glazed Octopus - really delicious, think of it as a de-constructed salad3. Akamiso duck breast - highlight of this was the tempeh! 4. Sashimi - good as always5. Pan seared scallop - I felt like this didn't really fit in with the rest of the set - the miso was very faint, and more prominently corn chowder-ish6. Surf and turf - the lobster tail was perfectly done, and even the carrots were amazing!7. Miku signature sushi collection - always delicious! 8. Strawberry Basil tart - nice and tart; although I find the white peach sorbet a little too acidic.What I would do differently is probably order a la carte instead of the kaiseki - and focusing on what they are good at which is sashimi, and aburi.  The set was a good way to try various options if you have never been to Miku before, however I really feel like it was not a good representation on their menu or the quality of the food.  Skip the set and focus on the aburi!",9/27/2020,3 star rating

12,Christine U.,"Montreal, QC","After reading a lot about sushi aburi and its popularity in Vancouver we decided to come to seemingly the main spot. We got the dining outside (?) combo special which was $39 for a miso soup, beef cheek appetizer, shrimp appetizer and 10 pieces of sushi. Miso soup was standard which is fine, you really shouldn't do too much with it in my opinion. Beef cheek was super tender in a nice sauce with a single brussel sprout half. The shrimp was super super battered, a bit more than I'm used to but tasty. I liked getting to try an assortment of sushi. The standout was of course the salmon aburi, but I also quite enjoyed the mackerel and the scallop nigiri. The maki rolls were inventive. We sat on the deck with a view of Place Canada and the service was perfect. All around us people were asking to change their tables for whatever reason and they seemed very accommodating. All in all It was a great experience. The meal itself was a good deal, but their regular menu is quite expensive and we weren't completely full afterward. If price is no object for you then 100% eat here!",10/25/2020,4 star rating

15,Aaron T.,"Kitsilano, Vancouver, BC","Having at first been deterred by the high price point of the menu, I recently paid Miku a visit over the summer for a celebratory dinner and I was blown away by the wonderful experience I had there.  You will definitely get your money's worth and leave feeling full and wanting to go again.Our goal for this dinner was to try out the Aburi Prime plate at $58 for 9 pcs of premium sushi.  It was an effortless process to make a booking online and confirm over the phone, and we were seated right away.  Our server, Christina, was one of the most polite waitresses ever and she took the time to explain the menu's best points to my guest and I.  She also made recommendations from the drinks menu, and I have been ordering that drink (Bergamot Sour) ever since.  The Sashimi Platter is a very fair price at $25 per person with a thick cut selection of salmon, tuna, maguro, hamachi (yellowtail), ebi (sweet prawn), tempura prawn heads, hotate (scallop) and green and red seaweed.  It was about 2 slices of each per person and was a meal in itself.  It comes with 2 kinds of soy sauce to enjoy with the sashimi and helps to accentuate the flavour.  The freshness of the sashimi was unparalleled and each fish's unique flavour and texture shone through, which is a rare thing in today's sushi restaurants.The Miku roll ($10) and Garden roll ($8) were also nice, with the Miku roll being the better of the two.  You can order these in half orders and that gives you 4 pieces instead of 8 for each roll.Our server went the extra mile to give us an Amuse Bouche of Bonito to celebrate my guest's birthday.For the Aburi Prime, there are 9 pieces of sushi paired with different sauces.  They range in flavor intensity and our server instructed us where to start and finish the experience.  There is an info sheet that comes with the plate, but some notable ingredients were A5 wagyu with truffle, Sablefish with yuzu, Spot Prawn with Miku sauce and Bluefin O-Toro to name a few.  Each piece is masterfully created to be an experience with all the ingredients working in harmony with each other.For dessert, (and you should definitely do dessert), we had the Citrus Jasmine Mousse ($14) and the Yuzu Mango Chiboust ($14.59).  Everything was very refreshing, delicate and creatively plated with different textures.  We also had two scoops of the sorbet.  The Green Tea Opera Cake is a favourite among locals and is also another standout if you know how long the entire process takes to make the dessert.Another experience I had here was just for drinks and I was delighted that they were able to accommodate my party of 7 on short notice.  Every cocktail ordered was amazingly flavourful and the perfect amount of alcohol.  I enjoy seeing how much thought gets put into the drinks menu at Miku to elevate the guest's experience, whether a regular or new customer.",4/3/2020,5 star rating

17,Elisabeth P.,"North Bend, United States","When planning our adventures in Vancouver, Miku was on our must nom list. Between the mouthwatering pictures and killer reviews I was sure it would be the perfect spot to take that husband of mine who is happiest when he's in Japan. We were lucky enough to get a reservation on a weekend even though there was a pretty large conference going on at the convention center. The dining room is really stunning with brightly colored painted fish dancing over the open kitchen, contemporary lighting and a clean crisp color palate, and of course a gorgeous waterfront view.Despite the extensive wait when we arrived, our dinner reservation was kept on time and we were seated promptly. Our server was very helpful in pointing out the gluten free items (designated by gf symbol) on their menu including their miso soup which is a rare find. We continued to have excellent service the rest of the night despite him being very busy we never went a moment without our water glasses filled or without him checking to see if we needed anything. We decided to share the edamame which was salty and satisfying. The husband had a roll with crab and eel which he said was fresh and tasty. We shared another roll of salmon, tuna, and avocado that was nicely balanced and kept us coming back for more until we almost had a domestic over the final piece. I also had the sashimi platter which was the most beautifully presented sushi I've ever eaten. It is a pretty pricey place but the good thing is that there is a decent selection on the menu from 20 dollar dishes to 150 dollar gourmet tasting menus, there's bound to be something for everyone.",3/8/2020,4 star rating
18,Eric L.,"Los Angeles, United States","Okay, knowing Miku as an iconic restaurant of class that we only splurge on for someone's birthday like once every five years... - Salmon oshi sushi: just so excellent. I almost cried when I had my first bite. What a delectable smokiness in the light touch of creamy sauce. What a lovely slight sear on the salmon. Just so pretty~ we ordered 3 servings of this (though we did have a big party of people)- Ebi oshi sushi: not as good as salmon but still excellent- Miku roll: again just doesn't live up to the salmon oshi sushi- Soba - an amalgamation of harmonious flavours- Sashimi - honestly don't think this is super special- All of the desserts - OMG THEY ARE SO GOOD. Green tea opera is excellent as are the ice creams... Such delicate design but also TASTY (just the right amount of sweet).

The Brussel sprouts were surprisingly my favourite dish, but the carpaccio and sushi rolls are stellar as well. Everything is clean and well maintained. Right beside Waterfront station, and there's nearby parking in the underground corporate parking areas and on the streets (street parking is generally cheaper).

20,Joanna L.,"Vancouver, BC","This place is always always busy and bustling. Located on the water, the restaurant has great vibes and an urban interior. I visited Miku for my sister in laws big 4-0 in the private room. Apparently, Beyonce dined here and sneaked our the back door when media found out  anyhow, behind the big, glass, red doors is a private room for parties - from what I recall, there is a minimum spend you have to meet. I walked in and the server greeted me right away and asked me what I wanted to drink...of course I said wine. She brought me a nice crisp rose - and goodness, you know the server is great, when your wine glass is NEVER empty! We had a set menu of all their goodies: 1st course: seared scallop, Kushi oyster, tuna tartare and ebi Mayo - everything of course was amazing. Mouth bursting with Wonderful flavors - I just wish they gave me  two yam chips instead of one for the tartare2nd: ""surf & turf"" ooommmmgggg! Both the sable fish and beef melted in my mouth - sable fish cooked perfectly with a crispy skin and the beef, was so soft 3rd: oshi, nigiri and rolls - Oshi is always my fave but the rolls were yummy also4th: Matcha dessert - I'm not a huge sweet fan, but mmmmmmhmmmm... loves the bitterness of the matcha with the crispy chocolate wafer and the hazel nutty chocolate ganache in between!! Perfection. Overall, it was a fantastic experience, EXCEPT, that 2 friends, my older sister in law and I, all had the same stomach issues (if you know what I mean) - we think it might have been from the oysters. ‍ hence the 4/5 stars and not 5/5",3/11/2020,4 star rating
21,Regina X.,"Seattle, United States","We came here for the lunch shokai after we couldn't get dinner reservations, though thankfully the lunch menu is a shorter and lower priced version of Miku's dinner menu. My friend got the Aburi Chirashi tart, which is more filling than expected and bursting with flavor from it's artfully layered ensemble.Lunch shokai comes with two appetizers that, on the day we went, were the braised beef (so tender with a small scoop of mashed potatoes and a roasted brussel sprout) & the tempura shrimp. I love shrimp and was impressed by the large and juicy pieces in both the appetizer and the 10-piece set. I love that Miku's not the omakase style of one nigiri/bite at a time. You get the full set in one go, and can ask your server to explain each piece. The recommended order to eat is starting from the nigiri and ends with the aburi (flame seared sushi), creating a beautifully eclectic taste journey. Highlights: bluefin in the spoon & the three aburi (especially the one with jalapeño).Overall, Miku was a highlight for us visiting this side of town, and impressed with its great service and food. From the artistic menu to interior, you're also likely to have a good time enjoying the waterfront views on a good day!",2/23/2020,5 star rating
22,Maggie L.,"Burnaby, BC","Miku is definitely one of the first to do oshi sushi well in Vancouver. Miku offers traditional Japanese cuisine with a modern twist.We ordered the Miku waterfront platter featuring Vancouver's local fresh seafood. This seafood platter came with an assortment of sashimi and prawns, kushi oysters, and even a delicious scallop ceviche. A couple of the oysters weren't super fresh but majority were good.We ordered their oshi sushi as it is a must at miku. Of course it's perfect as always.The ebi fritters were delicious as well.

23,Catherine X.,"Boston, United States","Honestly I'm not the biggest fan of Sushi in general but Miku blew me away with its service and high-quality tasting sushi. Salmon Oshi Sushi: this is definitely my favorite, and a must-get while you're here. (5/5)Saba Oshi Sushi: this one was slightly salty for my taste, but the extremely soft texture of the Mackerel with the rice made it a decent combination. (3.5/5)Miku Roll: a bit heavy on the sauce, nevertheless I'm in love with the Miku sauce in general and would recommend this for a first time staple. (4.5/5)Green Tea Opera: the waiter was actually very sweet and asked if the day was a special occasion from the very beginning of the meal. He kept in mind that it was a birthday and delivered the message on the dessert. The cake was amazing - it was the right amount of crunchiness in the wafer combined with the sponge cake. (5/5)We were pretty full coming in so we didn't order much, but I was amazed by Miku's service and would definitely love to come back in the future.",7/18/2020,5 star rating
24,Setu J.,"Philadelphia, United States",Miku was a sushi experience par none. We started with the calamari and it was served with a magical tosazu sauce. The squid was in a perfect tempura batter and fried for just the right amount of time. We got the waterfront platter. The fish is sourced from another planet. It was so darn fresh. Salmon was red. And I mean red. I was made aware that Vancouver has a top sushi game.  Nothing I was told prepared me for the Aburi Oshi Sushi.

After the soba we had sushi. The red wave roll, good but not great. The ebi Oshi was INCREDIBLE. Then the seared sushi (yellowtail, tuna, scallop, shitake and eggplant) was all just amazing.

The food was SO GOOD and delicate. The price is very worth it for its quality.Ebi Fritters - giant crispy prawns, they used a very thin layer of batter and fried the outside to golden brown. It was so crispy and the shrimp was so plump and fresh. Miku Rolls - salmon, snow crab, and cucumber rolls. You can taste the freshness of the salmon and snow crab all in one bite. Salmon Oshi Sushi - signature dish. This was perfect. Thin cuts of salmon were layered between rice. The top was seared with a special sauce. The sushi melts in your mouth! Saba Oshi Sushi - cured mackerel with miso sauce. We were warned to not get this if we didn't like the smell of mackerel. The flavor was really strong but we liked it nonetheless!The service was flawless and our server was very meticulous with the order of the food that came and checked in with us multiple times to see if we were enjoying the night.

The premium select set is great because you ge to try a piece of almost everything.  I especially liked the ebi Oshi.  It had a balanced meaty and citrus taste.  Miku roll is quite possibly the best roll I've had.  It has the same Miku sauce as the salmon Oshi and tobiko is an explosion of yumminess in your mouth!!

The miku signature selection was a chef's selection of traditional and aburi oshi, specialty rolls, and nigiri. I loved EVERYTHING, but what really stood out to me was the red wave roll & the salmon oshi sushi. The red wave roll consisted of prawn, avocado, wrapped in red tuna, with masatake sauce and the salmon oshi sushi had pressed bc wild sockeye salmon, jalapno, and miku sauce. The aburi oshi sushi is flamed seared with Japanese charcoal. They recommend eating everything without soy sauce so you can enjoy all the flavors, but of course, if you need soy sauce, they have some available for you.Would highly recommend with a request to sit by the windows to get a beautiful view of the waterfront.",11/27/2019,5 star rating

But what we got was so delicious, that we didn't care about having more options.I got the Kale Goma-ae (sweet sesame soy). I think I preferred the kale to the typical spinach. It was chewier and had more texture. I loved the sauce and it was a perfect amount. I also got the Garden Roll (avo, red bell pepper, cucumber, shiso, wrapped in pickled watermelon radish). Holy lord, this was absolutely beautiful. The presentation is incredible. And the flavors are out of this world. No need for soya sauce here.And that came to $50 (we had a glass of wine as well).

35,Regina K.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, United States","Dined at so many amazing restaurants during my weekend getaway in Vancouver, but Miku was definitely my personal favorite! Though, I might be slightly biased since sushi is my favorite food ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.Aburi Prime: 5/5It costs $58 (CAD) and comes with 9 nigiri pieces. One plate certainly wouldn't make you full; however, I think it's still worth trying because the sushi is top-notch. If you had to splurge on fancy sushi at least once in your life, Miku is the place to do so! The aburi prime is a preset menu and it is recommended to eat the sushi in the order of top to bottom/left to right (this is so that you go from the lighter flavors to the strongest).Ranked in order of what I liked the most: -BC Sockeye Salmon: the jalapeño saikyo miso aioli was amazing and is still unforgettable in my memories-Nagasaki O-toro: the toro wasn't too fatty, but it was still very soft and delicious! Again, the sauce was on point :3-BC Botan Ebi: the prawn comes in a slimy, creamy texture that makes it melt in your mouth-Fukuoka Miyabi-Dai (snapper): has a sweet and subtle floral taste-Kumamoto Kanpachi (amberjack): soft texture & light floral flavor-Akami Hon-Maguro (seared brome lake foie gras): not the typical foie gras flavor & soft texture-Koji Cured Gindara (sablefish): has a strong flavor due to the yuzu zest/fresh citrus-Hokkaido Hotate: typical scallop - good, but not that memorable-A5 Miyazaki Wagyu: soft texture & has that melt-in-your-mouth quality, but it wasn't the same like the others; it was meat after all. Takeaway: you know the sushi is legit when it melts in your mouth and Miku's Aburi Prime does just that. On top of that, each piece is beautifully decorated, making your plate aesthetic AF.Ebi Fritters: 5/5It costs $17 (CAD) for 5 pieces, but we got an extra piece ($3.50) to split evenly between 2 people. For an appetizer, I wasn't expecting much out of these fried shrimp. However, I was really impressed with how good they turned out. Each piece was pretty big and they were lightly fried with some kind of mayo sauce on top. It also comes with a small salad on the side. Although we ordered this towards the end of our meal (since our stomachs weren't completely full), this dish would be a great starter - highly recommend!!Salmon Oshi Sushi: 4/5$18 (CAD) for 6 pieces. Miku has a unique way of searing their sushi and I think it's worth trying for yourself. It was my first time trying ""aburi"" (flame seared) sushi and I have to say it was a great experience. As you can see from the pictures, the seared salmon is on top and there's also a sushi in the middle of the rice. The pairing is perfect and will most likely cause a foodgasm in your mouth.Green Tea Opera Dessert: 3.5-4/5$14.50 (CAD). Since I came here for my bday dinner, I couldn't leave without a dessert. Our waitress recommend the green tea opera as it was a popular choice among customers. The matcha ice cream was delicious, but I wasn't a huge fan of the dark chocolate cake.

I wish they'd have complementary miso soup especially when ordering sets like the Aburi Prime so I'm giving it 4 star for the service and sushi.O-toro handrolls are normally my go-to and even though they didn't serve handrolls, our waitress was willing to go ask the chef to make it for us. They ran out of o-toro the day we came but the chu-toro was just as fantastic! We also ordered the ""Miku Caramel Tarte Tatin"" dessert. It was disappointing because I expected to be more of a chocolatey dessert but it was more of a deconstructed Apple pie; this was completely my fault since I didn't read the menu carefully. It wasn't a bad tasting dessert but definitely something I'd order if I were to go again.",1/4/2020,4 star rating
37,Selina C.,"Richmond, BC","Hopping on the miku train! We had to get their sushi platter for 5 ($60) it was too good of a deal to not! Honestly it says for 5 people but realistically it's for 2-3! However this along with 2 of the classic Japanese shoyu ($13) its the perfect meal for 4!*Sushi platter has their signature items which I love getting there! Their salmon Oshi is super delicious, love the taste, and the texture was super creamy!*Their ebi oshi is the best because it has a lemon vest to it, and it kind of tasted like a lemon zest sushi which I loved*Their Saba oshi was ok la, it's not my ideal fan favourite but overall still super soft, and tender!*Spicy shrimp and spicy tuna roll, is a classic. It has a slight kick to it, which is good. However, it's not my ideal as it was harder than I would've assumed.*The ramen was a good deal, the soup was super rich, and the noodles were soft. It's recommended to heat up the soup prior and trust us it's the good idea! It wasn't the best ramen we've had but it was not bad for $13!* 5.5/10 - honestly takeout was not that good. The sushi rice was hard and the quality just wasn't exactly there. The only one that was good was the salmon oshi, but overall you can tell the rice was in the fridge prior and it was a quick Prep. Not miku quality. But they are super busy.* 6/10 - it is pricy sushi however it's miku so if you'd compare eating it at the store and at home it's way cheaper than expected! Usually it would be $150+ for 2 people, however with the 4 of us it was only around $100!",5/18/2020,2 star rating
38,Michael C.,"Oakland, United States","Miku was one of the best sushi experiences of my life, and I cannot recommend it enough.And this was after having one of the best sushi experiences of my life at Shiro's in Seattle, which I likewise cannot recommend enough.Miku is just such a unique experience, I have never had something like it, and I constantly think about it because it was that unique and delightful. The place is HUGE, immaculate, and has one of the largest staffs I've ever seen. Every member was polite, helpful, friendly, and clearly hard working. I was blown away by the treatment here. Make sure you get a reservation! And there are two bars - the sushi and the drink bar. While I enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar, it is a very different experience from other sushi bars - more flames.So that takes us to one of the other reasons this place is so unique: they focus on a style of sushi called Aburi. Basically they take the fish, pair it with a sauce and garnish, sometimes flame sear it, so that you have the perfect bite. They aren't kidding.I ordered the Aburi Prime, which comes with 9 pieces of beautiful nigiri. As the waitress was pointing out every piece, mentally I was going ""Ooh, I love kanpachi. That will be my favorite. Oh wait, Otoro! That will be my favorite.""What happened was I took that first piece, monkfish, ate it, and said ""Wow, that might be the best piece of sushi I've eaten in my life.""The second piece was bluefin, and after eating it said ""No, that might be the best piece of sushi I've eaten in my life!""It went on like that for all 9 pieces, which were: Monkfish, Bluefin, Kanpachi, Sockeye Salmon, Ebi, Otoro, Hotate, Cured sablefish, A5 Wagyu.Honestly, it was a flavor ride that I thoroughly enjoyed and miss as I write this. But let's be real, after eating 27 pieces at Shiro's, 9 pieces, as mind blowing as they were, weren't going to cut it. So after looking at the menu, I decided to go with the Miku Signature Selection, which is a mix of everything else special they do: a piece each of their Aburi Oshi Sushi (Salmon, Ebi, Saba); a piece each of their Specialty Sushi (Miku Roll, Red Wave Roll, Garden Roll), and 4 pieces of select nigiri. It was all really good, but after having Aburi Prime, it ruined everything else.So if going and a big eater, I highly recommend just ordering TWO Aburi Prime for yourself and then you can really enjoy two pieces each of that feast.And with consuming a large portion of fish and rice, I still had to get a dessert, and they all sound amazing here, especially the Green Tea Opera, which came recommended by my waitress. However it seemed a lot, so I went with what I was hoping was a simple coconut lychee sorbet.They don't do simple here. I got a small dessert platter full of fruit, small pastries, and the sorbet. It was another flavor ride from the biscuits to chocolate to fruit with the sorbet. Miku Vancouver is worth the hype - it is an overall amazing experience that any sushi fan should experience at least once. I can't wait to go back.",10/29/2019,5 star rating
39,Jack T.,"Sunnyvale, United States",My wife and I came for our anniversary.We ordered the special sushi plate and it was very good. The way they bring it to you is all the bites at once (9 total) which I think is more efficient than 1 by 1 or whatever. Appetizer of fried shrimp was good as well. Drink selection was very good as well.+ Service was good+ Atmosphere was good+ Food was goodDefinitely worth a try if you are in Vancouver,10/29/2019,5 star rating
40,Alika N.,"San Jose, United States","It has been almost four months since I ate here and I honestly can't stop thinking about it. Whenever I crave sushi, I think of Miku... and it makes me sad because I'm not in Vancouver. Dining here was one of the highlights of my trip - we actually ate here twice because it was that good! The ambience was so nice. We asked to be seated outside so we could have the view of the harbor and the sunset. It was a dream! The service was excellent! Our waiter, Lenny, was amazing. He was very personable and friendly. He thoroughly explained the menu to us (kudos for memorizing everything) and offered great recommendations. Lenny definitely made our experience a memorable one! He even went above and beyond to suggest other restaurants and activities to do in Vancouver. My boyfriend and I ordered half a dozen oysters, an Aburi Prime sushi plate each, and Salmon Oshi and Miku Roll to share. Everything here was delicious! Oysters tasted really fresh and were great starters. The Aburi Prime was perfection -- I loved every single piece! The Salmon Oshi is different from a traditional sushi roll but was so good and unique that I can distinctly remember its taste. I find it so interesting that it's in the shape of a rectangle. The dessert was also really good! Lenny noticed that the ice cream was melted when he served it to us and brought us another scoop in a bowl. He was the best! I'm dreaming of my next trip to Vancouver as I'm writing this review just so I could eat here again!",10/28/2019,5 star rating
41,Debbie W.,"Richmond, BC","Miku is one of my favorite Japanese restaurant in Vancouver. When I say favorite, it means I want to go there all the time if I could, haha. Whenever I have family and friends visiting from out of town, I always recommend that place for people who appreciate fine dining. It was my hubby's birthday, and I know how much he appreciates fine Japanese cusine, so I took him there to celebrate his birthday. At that time, they had a special cherry blossom 6 course tasting menu going on. We decided to give it a try. I got to say the presentation for the entire meal was flawless. Everything was nicely plated with elegance. Each course meal was prepared with attention to detail. They used the cherry blossom bento box for the main course, which was a traditional Japanese way to serve their meal. My hubby couldn't appraise more about how buttery the Kobe beef was. It just melted in our mouths! The seafood were super fresh, with the minimum of seasoning because the chef wanted the actual flavor of the food to stand out. The service was never disappointing, our waiter came to explain the ingredient after each course was served, and always there when we had a question or needed something. Everyone there was very friendly and professional. It was truly a wonderful experience for the both of us. I can wait to go back again!",11/28/2019,5 star rating
42,Kelly K.,"Burnaby, BC","This is a place to go for a date or a celebration! The service and ambiance are amazing. They are known for their aburi sushi, If you can't decide then get the aburi platter; It comes with a piece from each roll to try. They also do a lot of cooked dishes. When the seafood soba came we were a little disappointed because there was no flavour in the soba and we had to dip it in soy sauce. When the waitress found out she immediately offered to get it remade and the second plate was so much better! I would say the standouts were the o-toro sashimi and ebi fritters. These were one of the best Ebi fritters I've had in Vancouver. Unfortunately I did find a piece of bone in their nigiri sushi and I tried two of their desserts the matcha cake and the basil tart but they were not memorable. The drinks were really good though.",10/9/2020,4 star rating
43,Priscilla Y.,"Vancouver, BC","First time here and it was during COVID 19 of all things meaning take out was required and gladly enjoyed! The prices during this time are a bit lower but still quite a splurge for my birthday dinner this year. The deluxe sushi platter had scallop and hamachi nigiri, salmon aburi and saba aburi. Their salmon aburi was as good as people say and the saba was delicious as well. My favourite was the hamachi which was surprising because the colour looked a little bit off (but I understand with the situation that the turnover rate is slower). A very thin slice but tasted amazing with a deliciously tender bite and good sushi rice. We also really enjoyed the tuna tataki (with a wonderful sauce), and although the soba looked a little smashed in the box, it was tasty! Their chicken nanban bento was a little pricey for what was given but the nanban itself was quite tasty. The chicken kaarage was flavourful and had large pieces as well. We also got a few things from Gyoza Bar at this time including their baos, pork gyoza and chicken katsu curry. The gyoza was only okay and we hardly touched the baos (too full) but that katsu curry was delicious! Not spicy at all, a little sweet with pork bits, all onto a well friend chicken steak and white rice. Overall, Miku was absolutely delicious but I think i expected quality to be a little bit higher. I still would love to come back one day and try out their chirashi tart but we were all very satisfied with the meal.",4/11/2020,4 star rating
44,Mimi N.,"Seattle, United States","First time eating sushi in Vancouver and overall, it was an enjoyable meal. Highly recommend making reservations in advance if you have a preference in seating (booth/view/etc). For parking, there are nearby lots and this place isn't too hard to locate.For food, my date and I opted for the following: -Ebi Fritters: Sooooo tasty! Definitely worth a shot if you're a fan of prawns. Each prawn was hugeeee and the sauce was quite yummy.-Unagi nigiri: Ordered this one a la carte but it was so worth it. Noms. -Aburi Chirashi Tart: Think sushi cake if you don't know what this is. Layers and layers of various ingredients and while it's pretty to look at, it's quite tasty and filling too. -Lunch Sushi Set (forgot the name): Consist of 1 of each oshi sushi + 1 of each roll + 3 individual nigiri of chef's choice + miso soup. Solid choice to go with if you want to sample everything without having to order a bunch of food! Below are notes on the various items in the lunch set. -Salmon Oshi Sushi: If you're at a loss of what to eat, I highly recommending going with this dish. Such a unique twist on the salmon / rice layering that upon devouring, you'll definitely be craving for more. Top fave of the night-Ebi & Saba Oshi Sushi: Both were tasty but definitely lost out to the Salmon Oshi-Nigiri: ALL WERE SO GOOD. Fish was fresh and overall, my tum tum was happy-Rolls: Not a fan of any of the rolls. Compared to the deliciousness of the oshi and nigiri, I would skip rolls and devote more moolah to the good stuffDessert: Green Tea OperaHonestly, after eating this piece of dessert, I wished I could make it my future wedding cake. IT WAS THAT GOOD. From the presentation to the taste, I love love love this dish. Try this dish if you're a fan of green tea!Despite the letdown of the sushi rolls, I would totally come back here again for the oshi sushi and the dessert. :D Yasssss.",9/25/2019,4 star rating
45,Samantha G.,"Vancouver, BC","Overall, I felt that I had very high expectations for Miku and they weren't exactly met. The service and food quality however was top notch. We had the aburi kaiseki. Everything was nicely plated and ingredients were fresh, but it felt as if there was something missing in terms of taste. The aburi and sashimi were great, yet these are dishes I can get elsewhere. The standout dish though was the surf and turf plate. Both the lobster and steak were perfectly paired, with fresh roasted vegetables and quinoa to cap it all off. I would go back to Miku for this dish. You will not regret it!",11/20/2019,4 star rating
46,Jonelle T.,"Bellevue, United States","Miku is basically the gold standard for sushi in downtown Vancouver. They specialize in aburi (flame-seared) sushi and the love and care put into each piece really shows. It's definitely not a place you can just walk in and be seated, unless you're planning on an early-bird lunch or dinner. Reservations for normal dining times should be made weeks to a month in advance.Miku is situated right on the harbor and never disappoints. The sashimi/nigiri is super fresh and the salmon oshi just melts in your mouth. Everything is seasoned so perfectly, you don't even need soy sauce. Favorite items are the ebi fritters, salmon oshi, saba oshi and the miku roll. The price point is quite high, so you likely wouldn't want to frequent this place weekly, but I'd eat here any chance I have!",9/19/2019,5 star rating

It was worth because it comes out to be like 28$ in USD. And you can add dessert on for another 6 Canadian. I recommend trying the dessert too. Perfect taste and right amount of sweetness. The sushi all of it was delicious. They specialize in the square crispy rice sushi nigiris. Pros: value for fresh fishThe apps that come with it is pretty bomb the meat was cooked perfectly with nice sauce and mash potatoes!

49,Betty C.,"San Francisco, United States","Miku was one of the restaurants that appeared to be most reviewed on yelp so I snagged us an early bird reservation (works out well for us with a baby in tow). There is a bar area but if you want table seating highly recommend a reservation.There are a variety of ways to order, kaseiki, aburri kaiseki, aburri nigiri, ala carte. The hostess suggested as a first timer we get the kaiseki option so we can try a little of everything. Everyone at the table must elect it if you do so.The plating was pretty and the presentation was nice. I would say a couple of tips:The kaiseki has more cooked than raw so if you are expecting an omakase with mostly nigiri options it's not that.I was surprised that there two beef dishes-carpaccio and the filet. Both of those were actually quite decently sized compared to the sushi which I wanted more of.I think for me I should have gone for the aburri set and also ordered additional nigiri. I am more of a true omakase fan however and not so much of kaseiki. So just a tip for new comers as they do recommend their kaseiki but just make sure that is what you want! Overall we still enjoyed our experience. It was a beautiful night and we sat on the patio and there was room for our stroller for our baby to hang out as we enjoyed our meal. They also asked us what we were celebrating and wrote happy anniversary on our dessert.",9/8/2019,4 star rating

This restaurant is beautiful it has a wonderful view of the ocean.Let's talk about the pan seared scallop dish which was so salty. It was 28 dollars for basically three scallops one sliver of chicharron and a lightly painted cauliflower pure they could of gave more than a painted tree branch of that cauliflower pure lol just saying. It could of taken off some of that saltiness from my scallop.The soba salad was good But, a little on the plain side. The spicy peppery arugula actually was a nice touch to the soba noodles.That sushi oshi ... Well of course this is delicious this is what they're known for.That dam matcha dessert was delicious. It looked as pretty as it tasted. Our server was great I dont remember his name it could be Steve because, he looked like a Steve. I doubt there's a Steve though.The dishes are plated pretty, the atmosphere was nice, the service was good but the foods just so expensive... I guess we are paying for that fantastic ocean view.

I love the seared technique of cooking and not to mention ... rectangular sushi :) We at first got the sampler plate but in the end just ordered a bunch of the salmon oshi dish because we loved it so much. Also their kitchen closes at 2:30pm and it turns into a bar style menu. Lastly we got a dessert that was the best tasting jasmine tea yuzu mousse flavored thing. Omg so good. I would not skip dessert and try them. I feel like you can't go wrong. The view outside of the restaurant is the best. We got a window seat and was able to see our cruise ship at Canada place. The restaurant is a bit hard to see if you're facing the port because it's literally right across from the port entrance/exit.

Turns out, I'd been to Miku a few years ago and had ordered sushi platters; this time, we decided to go with the Aburi Prime, which apparently is a new addition to the menu as aburi is what Miku is known for now.We were pretty hungry, so we each got an Aburi Prime platter, and then we also got one order of Oshi sushi, half salmon and half ebi.The Aburi Prime was AMAZING. Our favorites were the Kumamoto Kanpachi, BC Botan Ebi, Nagasaki O-toro, Koji Cured Gindara, and A5 Mizayaki Wagyu.

If i had to do this again, i would probably get an order of this for myself. We were't too hungry so this is all we ordered but with a normal capacity, another dish is probably necessary.

It may be because I made a few mistakes on my decision to come. 1) I came late at night so the ocean view was obviously pitch black. I believe part of the experience is the view! 2) I am not someone who likes fusion type sushi dishes. The sushi was good, but I just didn't like the extra garnishes, but if you are someone who do like fusion-type sushi it'd be a great place to come. I was sitting at the bar, and the way they make their sushi, it's almost like an assembly line.

There was 4 of us, but it was just filling enough, not to the satisfying level. If you do come, DEFINITELY must order all their oshi sushi. The way they make it is so unique and because it is seeping with flavor already, there's no need to add soy sauce and wasabi. The appetizers were just as delicious.

Probably the best I've had outside of Japan.My friend and I came to Vancouver for a weekend trip, and when we found Miku online, we knew we had to drop by and eat here. I made reservations online the day before we left, but there was only super late night slots left (10pm), so definitely make reservations earlier. However, when we dropped by Miku around 7pm, we were really lucky and managed to get a seat outside.The food is just absolutely amazing. My friend and I each got an order of the Aburi Prime, and then we split an order of Salmon Oshi Sushi. For dessert, we got the Green tea opera cake.Aburi Prime-absolutely divine. Each piece was wonderfully put together and almost melted in your mouth. The whole plate was also gorgeously out together. I highly recommend the plate, and would definitely get it again if I'm ever in the area!Salmon Oshi Sushi-delicious. I've never had sushi like this before, but it was amazing! If the nigiri from the Aburi Prime platter almost melted in your mouth, the sushi on this plate definitely did.Green Tea Opera Cake-the server told us it takes 72 hours to make this cake. I'm not great at reviewing desserts, but I just have to say the cake is beautifully plated, and and tasted amazing.Our server was also nice and friendly. She was chatting with us throughout our time, and always stopped by to check in to make sure everything was going smoothly.Overall, I loved my experience at Miku, and highly recommend anyone in Vancouver to visit.

She came with us to take us through elevator. It was a long way and we were surprised with such professionalism and hospitality. Food as usual was great. If you come to Vancouver and want to try some amazing sushi then this is the place to go. Everything on the menu tastes amazingly good.While leaving, again that staff member escorted us outside.Amazing food with equally amazing staff. Miku always impresses me :)",7/27/2019,5 star rating
70,Jill Akemi C.,"San Jose, United States","I'm not from Canada, but this and their sister restaurant Minami, have the best sushi I have ever had!! They have different shape or kind of sushi can the standard rolls, I'm not sure but I think they called it Aburi sushi? I came here during dinner hours had some cocktails and aburi. They had a packed house! I'm glad I made a reservation and didn't have to wait as long. I enjoyed having this experience at a different style high-end Japanese style restaurant. I loved all of their interior and decor, their servers had excellent service and the bartenders as well. The Salmon Oshi Sushi and Miku Rolls were there most popular sushis, and they were amazing! You would think aburi would taste like a normal sushi roll, but it actually takes sushi to another level. It was definitely worth experienccing!",7/4/2019,5 star rating
71,Leslie H.,"Cleveland Heights, United States","When my friend recommended this spot to me as the best sushi of his life, I was a little skeptical, having been to plenty of great places throughout OC/LA, but Miku definitely surpassed expectations and is now also hands down, my favorite sushi place of all time. GET THE SALMON OSHI. The phrase ""melts in your mouth"" is tossed around a lot to describe sushi, but you haven't experienced its true meaning until this baby is dissolving right there on your tongue; it's actually heaven, and that is hardly an exaggeration. The seared layer of buttery Miku aioli sauce on top of pressed wild sockeye salmon with that tiny kick of jalapeno was the most delightful explosion of flavor on my taste buds. This is the slowest I've ever eaten sushi, because I was really savoring every last bite. I usually don't eat ginger but after every piece I found myself getting a piece to reset my palate just so I could relive the experience all over again. You can get the Miku Signature Selection (10 pcs) or Omakase (9 pcs) to try multiple options or if you're lost on what to order but I would recommend getting the salmon oshi a la carte (6 pcs) because trust me, once you try it, one piece simply isn't enough. We got all three of the aburi oshi sushi choices (salmon, prawn, mackerel) and all were great, but the salmon was a clear standout. Ambiance is wonderful with beautiful views of the harbor right outside, and it's right at Canada Place where you can walk off your delicious meal afterwards. Service is also very accommodating - one of us had a shellfish allergy so they made a special allergy-friendly version of the salmon oshi roll she ordered and even let us get a half/half of the ebi (prawn) and saba (mackerel) oshi, with 3 pcs of each, since we wanted to split another 6 pc order and she couldn't eat prawn. If you only go to one food spot in Vancouver, Miku absolutely has to be it. I'm already thinking about what I would get here (aside from the salmon oshi of course) next time I visit the city!!",6/25/2019,5 star rating

73,Jennifer L.,"Vancouver, BC","The absolute best sushi I've ever had. I came here for lunch and tried the lunch tasting menu with 10 pieces and 2 appetizers for $38. It was definitely a good plate to see what the menu has to offer. However, you MUST get a plate of the salmon oshi aburi. It is lifechanging. Very pricey, but worth every penny! I also really enjoy the mackerel nigiri. The fish tastes soo fresh! If you have a small party like 2 people, I would recommend asking to sit at the sushi bar. You get a good show of watching the chefs prepare everything. Quite pricey, but definitely worth it every now and then for a special occasion. I would 100% recommend to try at least once while in Vancouver.",1/14/2020,5 star rating
74,Michelle N.,"Houston, United States","So I've heard oshi is the best sushi in Canada??I think they're right!It's hard to get reservations here so be sure you plan ahead of time.  Luckily, we walked in and there wasn't a wait.  The only options was the bar and the high topped table which I didn't mind.I started off with a butterfly g and t cocktail and it was light, refreshing, citrusy, not too sweet, and last but not least a hint of lavender bitters which I loved!As for our appetizers and entrees:--Ebi Fritters (5/5) - Beer battered fried shrimp, so delicious I even ate the crunchy tails.  The salad that came with it was very refreshing after a crunchy bite of the shrimp.  The sweet chili aioli was great, but I wish there was a little more on it or on the side.  I wanted to ask for more but our waitress never came by in time before we devoured all of it.--Aburi Hamachi Crudo (4/5) - Thick cuts of yellowtail rolled up into swirly design.  The sauce was very minimal so you just get a hint of the vinaigrette, needed a touch more.  The crudo's I've had in the past had a lot more sauce on the plate so this was the only down side for me besides that the fish wasn't so cold. (I think it was lightly seared) Other than that it was fresh piece of sashimi with some grapes, greens, jalapeño, and cucumber. --Miku Signature Selection (4/5) - Something great to start with if you can't decide what sushi pieces you want.   (Salmon, Ebi, and Saba Oshi Sushi) They were sooooo amazing!  I love the salmon and Ebi the most!  Very buttery tasting, you really dont need soy sauce with this.  It was the fish pressed rice, more fish and more rice.   I usually think sushi pieces have has too much rice but this all went perfectly together. (Miku, Red Wave, Garden Roll) - The description of the rolls is exactly how it tastes.  Just your average rolls and if that's something you're more into then this will be your best bet.  The order is my best to least favorite.  Nothing too great. (Hamachi, Tuna, Scallop, and ???) - What was the last sushi was called?  I don't know, but it was the best out of those 4 sushi pieces.   I cant remember that piece due to the girl that dropped off the food asked if I needed an explanation, I said yes and she went through it super super fast. (Guess she was ready to go home.)  They were all fresh except the scallop which is too slimy to my liking. --Japanese Wagyu Beef (4/5) - Not as buttery but still pretty good.  That seared taste on the beef was perfect!  Soft and chewy, seared and half raw.-- Chu Toro (4/5) - I was looking forward for the otoro, but unfortunately they were out.  This was our second option which is more of a medium fatty.  Rated this on myBf behalf and he liked it.--Aka Ebi (4/5) - This was way sweeter than the botan Ebi.  It was pretty fresh but it didn't wow us to give it a 5.  The meat was more white than botan ebi.  It does not come with the fried head ):--Botan Ebi (3/5) - This was the only one that came with the fried head.  Back at home we call it amaebi, the shrimp was very slimy and fishy.  I'm guessing this is their lower grade of ebi.I would definitely come back for the oshi which comes in 6 pieces per order.  The service was good, and our server really went over the items clearly.  She was very helpful when it came to the menu and drinks.",6/24/2019,4 star rating
75,Sam L.,"Vancouver, BC","The staff there are super attentive, they show up THE MOMENT you're finishing your last bite and they pay attention to many small details that makes the dine in experience more fun and enjoyable. It was my 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend and they gave us a little treat and did some BEAUTIFUL hand-lettering on the plate of our dessert. The food was also amazing, my personal favorite is the Salmon Oshi, it just has this smokey-rich flavor that is so addictive. If you can't decide you can also get the Oshi Sampler as well. The desserts never fail to impress me, I had the yuzu mango cheesecake and it was so delicious, not too heavy, but it was nice and refreshing to match the summer mood. Personally, I think their appetizers are underrated, the fried chicken with the asian coleslaw was my boyfriend's favorite but I really liked the Fritter Prawns, the batter was done just right plus herbs as an extra punch. If I have one complaint it would probably that the music is a little on the louder side so my boyfriend and I had a hard time hearing each other and felt like we had to shout, but otherwise it was a fantastic experience!!",7/8/2020,5 star rating
76,Gemma C.,"Redwood City, United States","Trying to find a good sushi restaurant while visiting Vancouver, and heard about Miku from husband's coworker. Made reservation online which was a pretty fast process. On the day of reservation, we arrived about 30 mins earlier, but got seated immediately. Our server was a super nice guy, did a round of introductions of most dishes and provided some recommendations. We came for the Aburi prime and that's also what he recommended most. So we got Aburi prime then another two appetizers, calamari and brussle sprouts. Brussel sprouts came the quickest. It's crispy on the outside, and tender in the center. Usually this kind brussel sprout dish is drizzled with balsamic vinegar, but this one is more of salt and red pepper which is quite unique. The calamari was made tempura style. Calamari itself is super fresh and almost sweet. The dipping sauce that comes with the calamari was a mixture of acidity and some kind of soy sauce/ oyster sauce. There are also pickled cucumber and beets bites on the side of the plate which was super refreshing after eating the fried calamari. So Aburi, there are 9 pieces omakase that are designed and prepared by sushi chef. Each piece use different meat and sauce. We had quite good sushi before in San Fran which were super expensive. For the price here, my expectation wasn't super high. But!!! I was totally amazed. For the price, you get huge pieces of all kinds of fish, fresh prawn, fatty tuna, scallop, and at the end a big piece of A5 wagyu! Also They put the nigiri in a order for consuming and provide a menu for name and ingredients for each piece. Every piece just gets better and better. The first two nigiri was lighter on the sauce. Then there's jalapeño sauce, citrus flower on top, all kinds of creativities that get to put on the rice and seafood that make them richer and more delicious. My top 2 favorite are Otoro and Wagyu. If come back to Vancouver, I'll definitely come back for other amazing sushi dishes, or maybe Aburi prime again!!",2/18/2020,5 star rating
77,Jane L.,"Los Angeles, United States","First meal in Vancouver.  After looking online during LONNGGG car ride, I decided on Miku because they had reservation and they were close to my hotel.  Miku was near the water (too bad, it was freezing as I would have taken a post dinner walk) and the restaurant was pretty and spacious inside. I was dressed super casually as I just came out of a long car ride, but it seemed like people here dressed up a little more.  Also, it was very loud inside, but the noise was manageable.  I got a pretty good seat away from the bar. After looking at the menu, I decided on a omakase and prime rib to share.  Our waitress was so nice.  She took our drink and food order pretty quickly.  The prime rib came out first and it was a HUGE piece of meat.  At first, I thought our waitress misunderstood and it was a portion for 2 people (but, I confirmed later that it was 1 portion).  I would definitely get this to share as for the price, I think it was a good deal.  The meat itself was juicy and tender.  The omakase was next.  I was semi full by this time.  But, the sushi was so pretty! And, each sushi piece tasted different.  OMG, there were some pieces that were just a party in your mouth. I would definitely come back here again. Maybe next time, I can come when the weather is nicer and take a post dinner walk.",5/24/2019,5 star rating

My favorite of the night was hands down the Miku Roll, never had anything like it - and it was melt in your mouth, smokey, delicious sushi. The salmon oshi was delicious as well, and similar to Kishimoto (with kishimoto being more on the salty side, this one's slightly more sweet in comparison, but they're both really delicious salmon oshi, the best you can get in Vancouver!)The Aburi Prime was the most beautifully plated sushi dish I've ever seen, my partner enjoyed it and each sushi was paired well together in terms of sauces, garnish, and fish used",5/18/2019,5 star rating
82,Jeff H.,"Los Altos, United States","Went to Vancouver over the past weekend with couple of my friends to attend another friends' wedding. Before our flight, everyone was hyped about this place and I was wondering.... is this place actually that good or is it over-hyped like multiple places in the Bay Area?Before coming to Miku we booked an early reservation on Saturday, 6/23/2019, at 11.30AM right before our friend's wedding at 4pm. But we ended up coming to the place on Friday, 6/22/2019, at 4pm right after we finished biking around Stanley Park at 3.30pm. We were asked to be waited for about 10 minutes then seated by the balcony area to eat our ""dinner"".  We ordered the Brussels sprout and calamari for starter and the flavour was nice but wouldn't be obsess with it. Then we ordered the 3 orders of Saba, 2 orders of salmon and 1 order of the ebi sushi. The salmon sushi felt like eating butter and melt in your mouth. Saba sushi has its unique flavour plus the small touch of  plum sauce (?) which made it really refreshing. While the ebi sushi was just overly killed by mayo. Overall, the flavour of Saba and Salmon are both great and would definitely come back here when visiting Vancouver again. Also the exchange rate was in our favor, so it's like 30% off for us. Win-win situation :)",6/27/2019,4 star rating

I didn't prefer the flavor of them. What I loved were the nigiri and aburi oshi sushi.  Then I ordered a few more orders of the aburi and a variety of nigiri. The toro was my favorite! I did enjoy the yellowtail as well. All of the fish was fresh and so tasty!  I wanted more food, but I was super full!  I definitely recommend this place if you are in Vancouver.  If I visit again I'll be back.

90,Jennifer H.,"Fremont, United States","One of a kind and truly special. If you're a fan of flame seared sushi (aburi sushi) then look no further and give Miku a try.On top of being a beautiful restaurant by the water, Miku serves up some delicious sushi. You have to get at least one of their aburi oshi sushi. My personal favorite is the salmon oshi then saba oshi, then ebi. The salmon is buttery, rich, and melt in your mouth good while the saba has a nice tangy and savory taste. On top of oshi dishes, I highly recommend the aburi prime plate. 9 pieces of unique, mouth watering, delicious nigiri all crafted with love from the Miku chefs. The plate is just an absolute must if you want an omakase style experience that your taste buds will love. If you want to go big then also add in the Miku Signature Selection which also features a unique set of pieces. I hardly deviate from ordering the things I've mentioned above because it's just too good. I recommend booking a reservation through open table if possible if not then try to go to right before dinner like around 4ish and stay for dinner (starts at 5pm) so you can order the plates.",3/6/2019,5 star rating

There were several couples around us, but plenty of space for privacy.I started with their house specialty sake which was a hint of sweetness.Fresh raw oysters were local, smaller, creamy and excellent.Aburi Prime-9 pieces of chef's nigiri omakase.

Sockeye Salmon w/jalapeño miso aioli, micro red ruby mustard leaf to A5 Japanese Wagyu w/uni, micro dianthus.I cannot say enough about this and highly recommend.As if this wasn't enough, we opted for their dessert platter of a sampling of all their specialty dessert items.

I ordered it delivered to my home again a few weeks later same quality and amount and it was still warm considering the 15 minutes it took to get here. Last night was so disappointing- the box looked different and even though the hot was divided it was Luke warm. But I was mostly upset that the original delicious box they had composed was sorely lacking and the meagre substitutions was no where near what I needed for dinner.

95,Stacy F.,"Philadelphia, United States","I was in Vancouver for a long weekend and was determined to eat all the seafood and sushi I could find. After reading other reviews, I stumbled across Miku and hands down was some of the best sushi I ever had. It's located near the waterfront and definitely could get very crowded. I would suggest making reservations for groups, especially on the weekend. Since I was alone, I was quickly seated at the bar. I loved being able to watch all the chefs carefully prepare each dish. The menu is relatively small and doesn't have a traditional ""sushi"" menu. As a solo traveler that's typically on a budget, I probably would have walked out. It's a much more expensive meal than I usually get for myself, but it is worth every penny. I ordered the Aburi prime that included nigiri and their aburi sushi. Aburi sushi is when it's flame-seared that allows the sushi to just melt in your mouth. It's like a creme brulee but in the sushi world.",4/2/2019,5 star rating
96,Jenna G.,"Carlsbad, United States","I had such a great time dining at Miku. I made a reservation for my birthday at 7pm on the Monday of President's day weekend. The only annoying thing was our waiter told us at 7:55 that 8pm was last call for food because they were closing early for their staff holiday party, which no one had told us when I made the reservation or when we were checking in.We were seated right away for our meal. The restaurant is spacious and cool views of downtown Vancouver and the water.I started with this amazing fancy gin and tonic- gin and elderflower liquor and some other things. It was 22 CAD though, pretty expensive, but it was big and the only drink I got for the evening. For food, we got a bunch of different things on the menu. We started with the calamari and the scallops, both which were delicious. The calamari was good because it was lightly fried, not heavily fried, and the scallops were AMAZING- with this bacon pineapple sauce and cauliflower puree. Then we got two rolls- the Miku Roll and the Wave Roll. Both were really good and full of flavor. I tired a few Nigiri- toro, hamachi, waygu. All were delicious, though I wish I thought to ask for no wasabi on them.Our waiter was super nice and friendly. He brought me a dessert for my birthday too, which was great! It was some hazelnut chocolate cake with coconut milk ice cream.

98,Chanelle D.,"Vancouver, BC","One of the best Japanese restaurants in Vancouver. Sushi in art form. The presentation is amazing, the flavour is unforgettable and the service is impeccable. If you know what to order, you will enjoy your experience here. I've been here several times and the delivery and experience has been consistent. Each sushi type has its own character and when you bite into it, an explosion of flavours set off in your mouth. Calamares are prepared differently and not deep fried - very tasty and light. The ambiance is awesome being at the waterfront hub of Vancouver only meters away from the Sky train station. I can't comment on the price as I've never paid for any of the times I've been a guest and parking is plentiful if you travel with a car as there are a lot of parking lots in this area of town.

99,Jordan N.,"Vancouver, BC","I had heard so many good things about this place before finally deciding to visit and I was not disappointed. Make sure to get reservations for the smoothest experience, and keep in mind lunch is less busy than supper. The service was great as the workers were able to answer everything about each meal. The food wasn't served that quick, but we didn't mind as we had appetizers to wait us over. I had The Miku Zen ($35) which was an assorted platter with samples from the raw bar kitchen and sushi bar. It composed of 4 small dishes and 6 pieces of sushi. The dishes were beef and potatoes, tuna and greens, prawn and salad, and another mix of fish and salad. My favorite of the 4 dishes was probably the prawn followed by the juicy beef. The 6 pieces of sushi we're good but I couldn't remember their names. My friend also ordered a bunch of stuff that I got to sample. I was surprised by the quality of the Calamari mostly. Probably the best Calamari I've had. Oh and the dessert holy moly. Best use of green tea flavoring I've tasted. Holy the crunch from the chocolate and sweetness from fruit. Yum.What I love about this place is that it makes good sushi accessible. When I go to Richmond half the menu is in japanese and I feel a culture divide (noticed by general mannerism).

I tried some shrimp, salmon and waygu for mine and it was outstanding!! The searing was perfect and the meat and fish were full of flavor, I couldn't get enough and actually ended up ordering more pieces. There is typically a long wait, but we just walked around the area and grabbed a drink until our table was ready which was perfect. The location is great and the restaurant is beautiful.

We were sitting at the sushi bar and we had someone filling our water constantly and checking to see how we liked the food. Will definitely come back!",10/13/2019,5 star rating
102,Nancy L.,"Oakland, United States","One of the best dining experiences I had in Vancouver. We sat at the bar so we were able to talk to the bartender and watch him make his drinks. Miku not only has a spectacular lunch and dinner menu, their craft cocktails are definitely worth trying. Our bartender recommended the Miyazaki #2 for those who like something on the sweeter side. It's mango puree based so it was sweet and a little tangy, but also frothy, creamy and delicious. You can still taste the alcohol so it will definitely creep up on you if you have one too many.My friend and I were very excited about the menu and couldn't wait to eat. Especially because our flight to Vancouver kept getting delayed and rerouted because of layovers, it took us way longer than expected to get here. Luckily, the wait wasn't too overwhelming for two people during dinner time so we got seated rather quickly. We were also able to walk around Gastown until the hostess texted us letting us know our table was ready. We ordered the Ebi Fritters which I just thought was a little bit underwhelming. The breading was crispy and it had a nice garlicky flavor to it, but I prefer the panko crust more than this one. The salad on the side helped cut the grease a bit, but I probably wouldn't order this item again. I'd rather try something else on the menu.We each ordered the Miku Signature Selection for $37, which came with an assortment of nigiri, aburi sushi and special rolls. There were a total of 10 pieces and the special roll pieces were very small, but delicious. I loved them all! The nigiri was great and the fish tasted very fresh. Miku is more well known for their Aburi Sushi so you should plan on ordering a few of these when you dine here. If I were to rank the aburi sushi pieces, it would be the Salmon first, Saba second and then the Shrimp. They were the best three pieces on the omakase set. I absolutely loved it! I highly recommend this spot if you're visiting Vancouver and want a taste of what this city has to offer. Miku is a little on the pricier side so expect to fork over quite a bit, but just know that you're getting a high quality and delicious meal in return.",12/19/2018,5 star rating
103,Arabelle S.,"San Diego, United States","Visited Vancouver for a day trip from Seattle, and ended up having dinner at this gorgeous restaurant. Met up with my friends friend and she recommended this spot for dinner. I am so glad that we dined here.So, we made a reservation for five people on a Monday night. We arrived at the restaurant a bit early, but was seated promptly. The hostess were kind and friendly.We sat on a booth like table, I noticed how simple yet classy the vibe was inside the restaurant. Definitely enjoyed the music, and the ambiance was perfect for the setting.We ordered calamari, three orders of salmon oshi, miku roll, fresh oysters, and their seafood platter. Enough to share amongst five grown women.The food were fabulous, so fresh, and flavorful. I personally enjoyed the Miku Roll, since it melted in my mouth. The flavor was so satisfying that I could have honestly be happy with just that as my meal.Our servers were so informative and attentive. We never had our water glass halfway empty.We definitely had an amazing dinner at Miku and would definitely recommend this place to anyone who may want to experience delicious food, great ambiance, and amazing experience.",4/7/2019,5 star rating
104,Tim B.,"Dallas, United States","We wanted to come in for a quick bite and experience the sushi so we ordered their signature Salmon aburi oshi sushi and a sashimi plate! SERVICE:Wow I can't believe I had such a let down experience! I had heard so much from friends and through reviews on Google and Yelp . I liked that I was greeted upon coming in which is something I'm accustomed to. I've been to few other sushi restaurants in Vancouver and this was not the norm. I like being greeted when entering an establishment, it makes me feel appreciated and starts me off in a good place. I could tell the restaurant's service process here was exceptional however my personal experience was decent. FOOD:Their signature dish wash very underwhelming, the rice was not a good texture, a bit hard, and did not hold form properly - it sort of fell apart as we picked it up. The sauce did not tie everything together well, salmon was a decent freshness, nothing too special. For the sashimi, I'll just leave it at... Not fresh. It wasn't bad but my the standards of a restaurant that prides itself on creativity and presentation they totally missed the fundamental with the sashimi. Like I said, it wasn't bad but it definitely was not good. My cousin and I were throughly disappointed with this place and left in a hurry. SUMMARY:I don't let one bad experience define a restaurant (or anything really), so I'd definitely love to give this restaurant another chance! Unfortunately this restaurant wraps up my food tour in Vancouver and leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth, literally There was another sushi review I left the day before that was the best sushi I had in Vancouver. Not going to post it here",3/29/2019,3 star rating

106,Jen H.,"San Diego, United States","Miku ... The service was a bit lacking the night I dined...our reservation kept getting pushed back by nearly 45 minutes - but the manager made up for it by coming to our table to talk about the issue and offered us complimentary dessert at the end of the night, but holy cow did the sushi not disappoint. First of all, yes this establishment is $$$ and I am NOT a huge fan of seafood, but their Salmon Aburi (flame seared) Oshi Sushi was a huge hit. If beaches are the thing to visit in San Diego, and Golden Gate Bridge in SF...so worth...for this sushi establishment - FOR all seafood lovers and seafood newbies, this sushi will flameeee blow you away. The Salmon Aburi Oshi is adventurous as it features perfectly seasoned rice, thin salmon in between the layers of rice, flame-seared salmon on top and a perfect pop of jalepeno and cracked pepper and Miku sauce. The sushi is pressed and formed in a wooden mold. The sushi is cut into bite-sized rectangular blocks and presented so beautifully - it's hard to eat it. Until you do...all the flavors melt into your mouth and the flavors of from the charcoal grilled salmon bring about a pleasant smoky flavors that enhances the natural flavors of the local salmon-  but not fishy taste. This method leaves the salmon tasting more buttery than typical. Add some Miku sauce and it will melt in your mouth and leaveyou wanting to order another round. I am drooling as I write this....good luck just having one. Cheers!",1/17/2019,4 star rating

Had to wait about 20 minutes for the table and then got seated near the entrance where we saw every customer who came in or out of the restaurant. Other than the seating arrangement which was subpar, the food was really good. The oshi sushi is what Miku is known for and it didn't disappoint. Each piece of the signature selection had a different taste and texture and they all tasted great. The Brussels sprouts chips were tasty also.

For the price that I am paying, I expected better....I paid around $50 for a lunch set + a pint of beer.The only good side is that it is close to Canada Place.

They also have rolls so I got the Miku Roll and Red Wave Roll. Everything was so fresh and delicious.If you really feel like balling out, get their Sashimi Special to get a taste of some bomb ass melt in your mouth sashimi.

Arrived on a Sunday and waited around 45 minutes to be seated for a party of 2. Of the choices they gave us, we decided to choose sushi bar seating - because duh!I ordered: Coal Harbor Platter and Miku Roll. I've never ate slower in my life in order to try to savor each bite... It's not super filling, but that's not why you come to Miku. You come to Miku to taste how fresh and good quality fish and seafood you're putting into your mouth. They torch their rolls and fish (one of the only sushi restaurants I've seen that torch all their rolls). But tasting the torched fish, I can see why! On my trip to Vancouver, I was so happy I tried this place! Definitely not cheap though... expect to spend on the higher end, but worth it for a fancy night out with yummy fresh fish.

117,Phillip V.,"San Francisco, United States","I made a reservation on Yelp a few days before and was seated immediately. The atmosphere and service within Miku are top notch and the staff are attentive, knowledgeable, and helpful.I order the salmon oshi sushi and also the Red Wave Roll. The salmon oshi sushi is really popular and I must say the seared salmon flavor certainly lives up to the hype. It has a deep and rich flavor that I can't describe other than delicious and quite a bit different from the typical yummy, fishy flavor of salmon sushi. If you're dining at Miku, I must say the Salmon oshi sushi is a must-order. The Red Wave Roll was good not great. Tasted like a typical specialty roll at any sushi restaurant with nice, fresh fish.Overall, Miku is an awesome Japanese spot in Vancouver!",10/25/2018,5 star rating

All rolls and oshi sushi comes with their own sauce...for me, it was perfect with no additional soy sauce. But they have two types of soy sauce - normal and dark (yes!!) if you must have soy sauce.

119,Jayson Z.,"Markham, ON","Took my parents and my in laws for dinner for our last night in Vancouver, it was a pricey dinner but totally worth it. We got the summer kaisen kaiseki set. Overall in one sentence, ""the flavors blew my mind and opened my palate to another layer of senses"".The lobster tartare was really refreshing and was a great opener  to the show. The zensai, kaisen, and sashimi came together in a very great presentation, and the flavors definatepy matched the presentation. The sashimi was not only fresh, but took us on a journey of seafood with the yellowtail which was flavorful and lean to the fatty tuna and ending with a crescendo of flavor with the sweet shrimp. The next layer consisted of clams and a soft boiled shrimp, which sounds simple but the cooking of the shrimp was evidently at the pinnacle of timing as one millisecond less would be raw and 1 millisecond more would be overcooked. The next dish was seared scallops which was infused with Smokey bacon and sweet pineapple which was like the shrimp cooked perfectly, tender on the inside and nearly crispy on the outside. The next course was entree 1, the sable fish. Akin to its predecessors the fish was very tender and it was extra flaky. What made this dish my favorite was the many many layers of flavors. The fish itself was covered in a tangy sweet sauce which was very decadent but light and each ingredient adds another texture. For example the cauliflower sauce made the fish extra creamy, and the hidden wasabi based base adds an extra kick.The second entree was the aburi sushi. The aburi sushi platter had a piece of miku roll and red wave roll. Salmon aburi layered sushi and finished off with a himachi sushi and fatty tuna. What stood out the most which really surprised me (in an addition to the fatty tuna) was the way how the slice of jalapeño worked so well with the smokey salmon sushi, simply brilliant. Not only was the Smokey ness just right, it was just intense enough to overpower the kick of the jalapeño, but still leave the sharpness of it in your mouth.Lastly, to finish it off dessert was amazing and brilliantly named ""petit green tea opera""even though I'm not a big fan of green tea the symphony of green tea played a seamless ending to a great meal.",10/22/2018,5 star rating

121,Lala F.,"Richmond, BC","Extremely poor takeout service. Every time I call on the phone they are extremely rude. This not only happened to me but also with friends that have called for take out. Extremely unprofessional for a high end restaurant. Really makes me nor my friends want to order or eat at the restaurant. I already ordered some items and asked how many pieces were in an order of salmon sashimi. Instead of inquiring or letting me know the number of pieces, she instead asked me to go look it up on their menu online. She wanted me to hang up the phone, go search for their menu online and then call back and reorder my order.Every-time I've gone to Miku their in house dining service is excellent. Every-time I order through the phone with the female manager I've always had exceptionally rude service.

If you make reservations you can request to sit in the back where they have a gorgeous view is the water!

125,Tyler C.,"Owings Mills, United States","Top quality, touristy-with potential for varied experience. Flying to Vancouver, the person next to me had reservations at Miku for multiple nights. It has that reputation. Discovering the restaurant next to my hotel (right by Canada Center, the Pan Pacific and where the Cruise Ships dock make it busy, well known and a place that is talked about. So was it special?  Yes, there were special items. The three women who greet you and seat you gushed  over the restaurant and set a nice tone. The waiters know there stuff and explain how each item is unique and a Miku item.And some items truly where. I went full tourist and had the saki tasting flight (types chosen by the bartender-and all common sales from industrial size bottles. The sushi can be layered, flames like creme brûlée, or the common variety. I went sampler again and got 9 pieces of average size sushi, some nice, some not. The low rating is for leaving hungry after having some great food, some average food, and average drinks.  Having something hyped and then feeling let down. And spending close to 100 Canadian dollars. I would suggest going for the sushi that is special, and ordering rather than sampling. This place could be 5 stars, or could be average.",10/19/2018,3 star rating
126,Jessica C.,"Vancouver, BC",Simply put. Amazing. We had an early dinner reservation for two and got a window seat with a view. Our server was attentive and she described the dishes to us since it was our first time at Miku. We ordered cocktails and an appetizer to start and they were beautiful. My husband and I decided to get a selection of sushi and nigiri and it did not disappoint. He got the sushi signature selection and I chose the Aburi Prime. The dishes were incredible and the aburi prime was so good that we ordered a few a la cart afterward. The A5 Waygu nigiri is to die for. We decided to order dessert and while we were waiting our server brought us a taste of her favorite dessert wine to go with our dishes! What a nice treat because it paired perfectly. I cannot wait to come back here for another meal. Presentation is absolutely stunning and the quality is top notch. We really enjoyed everything about Miku.,11/6/2019,5 star rating
127,Tiff H.,"Dunwoody, United States","Miku is a must-visit sushi spot in downtown Vancouver that every local knows about. After perusing the menu, I was skeptical as to the authenticity. But with all the hype, I knew this had to be as good as all get out. Our server was charming and handsome. He was pretty helpful and giving us space but offering suggestions, as well. I ordered a butterfly gin and tonic, which came out as a pretty fruity cocktail. We then ordered a few apps to start - the ebi fritters and the calamari. Everyone at the table wanted to try the Aburi Prime tasting, which came with 9 pieces of intricately plated chef special aburi nigiri. We also decided to order a final a la carte order of the salmon oshi aburi, per the recommendation of our server, to fill our stomachs and satisfy our palates one more time before dessert. The ebi fritters and calamari were fine. Nothing too mind blowing, but occupied our attention while waiting for our main course. And omg what came next was worth the wait. Each aburi was paired with a unique flavor profile - my favorites were the tuna with foie gras (Akami Maguro) and the wagyu beef with uni (A5 Japanese Wagyu), the two richest flavor combinations. The depth of flavor and intricacy in each piece was undeniable. DEFINITELY worth $55!!!We splurged on dessert because we're already in so deep, might as well go all the way. We ordered the Green Tea Opera Cake and some homemade Mango Lime sorbet. The sorbet was tart and a good palate cleanser. But the green tea opera? My god. The dessert was so delicately plated in a beautiful display. The cake itself was light and moist. No wonder it's one of the more popular desserts!Overall, Miku isn't your authentic sushi joint but an upscale and modern Japanese fusion restaurant that is worth every cent!",8/23/2018,5 star rating

We didn't have a reservation and put our names down. They said it would be 30 minutes so we walked around the pier. Beautiful place. 15 minutes later we got a call that our table was ready. That was a nice surprise but if you do what we did try not to walk too far. Vancouver is a beautiful city and Miku encompasses that. You can see out into the pier and it is just a beautiful location.

131,Anthony L.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States","One of the best sushi place I've visited, not to mention at a super reasonable price, highly recommended!!My friends and I came here on a Saturday for lunch. It was a bit crowded, but we called to make the reservation in advance a few hours before arriving. Our waiter was super friendly and knowledgable--he greeted us whole-heartedly and explained everything on the menu thoroughly. We got Salmon Oshi Sushi and Steamed Edamame for the table, and I got the Premium Select for myself.I definitely was not exaggerating when I said this was one of the best sushi experience I've ever had. Even the edamame appetizer was amazing. The Salmon Oshi Sushi and Premium Select came with Aburi-styled sushi, which was a type of sushi where they pressed the rice into the rectangular shape. It was the first time I had Aburi sushi and they were definitely far better than I expected. The rice was lightly sweeten/flavored, and the fish melted in your mouth immediately.My final bill with tip came out to be $42 CAD (about $32 USD), which was super reasonable (even too cheap) given the quality of the sushi.A note to callout is the portion side could be a bit small. But quality over quantity is definitely the play at Miku.",12/16/2019,5 star rating
132,Linda L.,"Toronto, ON","Miku is at the top of my list of restaurant to try while I was on my trip to Vancouver. Having already been to their Toronto location, I had a fairly high expectation of the restaurant and my experience definitely lived up to the anticipation.We made a reservation for 4 a few days beforehand for Friday 11:30am lunch, as we know this place will be super busy, considering that it is a highly rated, high-end Japanese restaurant. The reservation process was easily done on OpenTable and they would send you an email to confirm the reservation. When we arrived, we were promptly led to our table by the hostess. Fortunately, we got a 6 person table for the 4 of us, so it was quite roomy to fit all of us, which was good since we planned on ordering a few items. The budget was definitely out the window this time!We ordered some drinks to start, which in terms of prices, the non-alcoholic drinks were quite reasonable at $5-6 each. Unfortunately, my friend who ordered the ""mojito"" found it too sour, despite the waitress recommended it as the sweetest drink on the list. For the main dishes, I got the Salmon Osho sushi, some a la cart nigiri sushi with Aburi ($0.25 extra to get them torched), and split a Salmon Chirashi tart with my friend. It took about 15-20mins for the food to arrive, since we ordered quite a lot of items and they were pretty much served together. The Salmon Osho was definitely my favourite as the salmon was so soft that it melted in my mouth and the cheese definitely added a great flavour. It was so good my other friends decided to order anther plate! For the a la cart nigiri sushi, they were already infused with soya sauce and wasabi, so no dipping is required. The high quality fish was definitely really fresh, tasted a little sweet, and definitely didn't feel fishy or watery at all. For dessert, we unanimously ordered the Green Tea Opera cake. The multi-layered cake was as good as I remembered, and the green tea ice cream on the side had a rich matcha taste. It's definitely a sweet way to end the meal.",8/4/2018,5 star rating

We arrive a bit early for our 5:30pm dinner reservation and had to wait a about 10mins before we were seated. For our appetizer, we ordered the seaweed salad which was delicious and very unique. For our entrees, we ordered the Salmon Oshi Sushi, Ebi Oshi Sushi (pressed prawns), Miku Roll, and the Garden Roll (for the vegetarian in our group). The Oshi Sushi is their specialty, the chefs seat the tops of the sushi and it makes for an amazing flavor. The salmon melts in your mouth and the Ebi Oshi Sushi has an amazon line zest that goes so well with the pressed prawns. The rolls were great too but the star of the table was definitely the Oshi Sushi. For dessert we got the green tea opera which was delicious as well.I took one star off because the service was very slow for our table. It felt like the waitress was very uncoordinated. When we were seated, we waited almost 30 minutes before she came to give us water and take our order.

Would definitely recommend making a reservation as they're usually pretty good with seating you right away. The server was diligent and engaging. She asked if it was a special occasion, which it was, and even provided us with a complimetnary taster on the house. We asked about the specials that night and the server was very informative and also provided wonderful suggetsions.We started with the sashimi platter, which was very fresh and tasty. The presentation was beautiful, and every piece was perfectly placed.We then had the A5 Wagyu, which was also suggested by the server and was even brought out prior to it being cooked. A bit like a show and tell, we were given back story of wagyu and what makes it unique. When it came out, the presentation was absolutely beautiful. It came with several different side sauces and each added a unique taste. If you've tried wagyu before, it is quite heavy due to the high fat marbling in the meat, so be sure to order a side of radish or rice to cut the fattiness. Note - wagyu is quite expensive, but it was delicious and was the highlight of our evening. We then finished with an order of the salmon oshi - which is an absolute MUST at Miku. Slightly smoked with a kick of the jalepeno - melts in your mouth and is so flavourful.Unfortunately we were too full for dessert but thoroughly enjoyed our dinner regardless.",11/16/2018,4 star rating

139,Angelica Q.,"San Francisco, United States","To preface, this is going to be a very long and in-depth review of Miku, comprising mostly of their Aburi Prime Omakase, where they bring ""flame to fish"" and essentially sear the raw fish to open up new doors of flavor. TLDR: the food is great, you should go.How does Miku's Aburi Prime Omakase compare to the traditional way of serving omakase? My boyfriend and I are both foodies and really enjoy discussing the quality, preparation, and our reactions to the meal. This was the silver lining to a one-plate Omakase experience vs a by-the-plate one, since we were able to really take our time to talk about each piece. So let's dive in, shall we?-- FUKUOKA MIYABI DAI (4 out of 5): nice little bite to start us off; you can definitely tell that the entire meal is going to be of fresh fish and amazing mouth feel-- AKAMI HON-MAGURO (5 out of 5): marigold?? I had to look this fish up because I thought it was a type of goldfish and it's basically around the same size; the flavor in this piece was GROUND BREAKING thanks to the perfect amount of sear, such a soft and almost teasingly good mouthfeel but such FLAVOR, we really enjoyed how unique and delicious this bite was-- KUMAMOTO KANPACHI (4 out of 5): I have loved amberjack since our first Omakase experience; Miku offered up good accompaniments for this piece but unfortunately, it fell short of previous experiences and also failed to escape the glorious shadow of the Marigold from the bite before-- BC SOCKEYE SALMON (4 out of 5): this was probably the thickest slice of fish at the table, which made for a satisfying mouthfeel and greater depth of flavor from the fish itself. However, besides the level of quality and generous portion size, the jalapeño aioli still shown through quite strongly and really brought the piece to the next level.-- BC BOTON EBI (5 out of 5): in my boyfriend's words this bite had ""all the things you like about eating cooked shrimp (crunchy tail, bouncy and plump texture) but adding in everything you want from eating sushi (superior handling of raw ingredients, soft mouthfeel)"". This is probably the single piece of sushi from the entire Omakase plate that I would take and show to all my friends in the states in order to preach the Aburi way of searing fish for better flavor.-- NAGASAKI OTORO (5 out of 5): the marbling on this piece of fatty tuna was insane, probably second to actual wagyu marbling. Who doesn't love fatty tuna?? It's so melty and good.-- HOKKAIDO HOTATE (3 out of 5): scallop is probably one of the largest hit-or-miss bites for me; their taste of the sea must be tamed by a combination of stronger and subtle flavors, which I didn't really see here.-- KOJI CURED GINDARA (4.5 out of 5): if you like eel, you're going to love sablefish. Besides the fish, the additional flavor pairings were amazing and well thought out-- A5 MIYAZAKI WAGYU (5 out of 5): A5 wagyu is hard to mess up if you're trying to make it taste good; you almost always say ""oh I really liked the meat"" over any other flavor pitfalls it may have. This is not the case with Miku's wagyu; the amount of sear is so intelligently used to level up the taste of the beef to the point where you question if wagyu was supposed to be eaten any other way.After the Omakase plate, based on our waiter's recommendation, we also enjoyed their Ebi (Shrimp) Oshi Roll. It is not hand formed, as most sushi generally is, but actually done by a mold in which the piece of fish is pressed into a very flat shape and thus provides a radically different mouthfeel. Very unique, and we enjoyed it so much that we got their Saba (mackerel) Oshi to take home, again based off our server's recommendation (he said the mackerel at Miku was sooo good, it was his favorite fish to eat).Miku's Aburi Prime is a great taste test of what the restaurant has to offer and, next time we come, we will have one of their multi course speciality meals and experience a palate of pleasure once more.Of course, great food can only take a restaurant partway. I had the blessed opportunity to dine here with my boyfriend and have David as our server. Especially since the experience of conversing with the chef that makes your food is lost with one-plate Omakase, having an excellent server becomes much more important. David performed spectacularly: he checked in on us often, gave us AMAZING recommendations, made us feel really at home and welcome to Vancouver, and treated us like friends more than customers. Our time at Miku would have been much less enjoyable with any other waiter, we really loved having David serve us. @owner of Miku, please open up a place in Los Angeles so that David could be our server there, we'd make so many more trips to there since it's closer to home for us than Vancouver. His flair for service and amazing way at connecting with his customers was incredible and, when we come back next time for their Miku course, I would want to have him as my server hands down.",1/17/2020,5 star rating
140,Ly W.,"Vancouver, BC","Came on a weekend evening with reservation and ended up waiting around 10 minutes. The hostess walking us in did not acknowledge us for waiting even though we made a reservation and still had to wait. She walked around the entrance yelling out my name and didn't say anything to us or smile. Our server was very friendly, but was not attentive. She came to our table within the first 5 minutes after we got seated and asked if we had questions. We then waited 15-20 minutes before she came by again to take our order (we sat there waiting even though we were ready). Our water was not topped off until we flagged her down. For a restaurant that charges this price, you would expect better service. The dishes are good, but I don't think they are spectacular.

143,Carl C.,"Surrey, BC","I've heard so much about Miku, yet having lived in Vancouver for so many years, I never got around to trying it! Since it was a co-worker's last day, we all walked over to Miku for a farewell lunch.Everyone recommended their special lunch combo (Miku zen) so I decided to get that as well. It comes with 4 small bowls of hot/cold dishes, as well as 5 pieces of sushi. All I can say is Wow! The sushi was absolutely delicious and flavourful, especially the salmon and shrimp. The sauce on top of the shrimp nigiri was honestly one of the best things I've ever tasted! The 4 bowls were also great: the beef with gravy and mashed potatoes, and the chicken with seaweed were quite enjoyable. However my favorites were between the shrimp fritter - which was so juicy and well-seasoned, and the salad - which had so many ingredients that somehow worked well together.We finished off with the opera cake, which was full of green tea, chocolate, and matcha ice cream goodness, and a perfect way to end the meal. It's not the cheapest lunch at $50 per person, but honestly worth every bite!",6/22/2019,5 star rating
144,Jackson H.,"Redmond, United States","I fell in love with aburi sushi ever since I was had a taste of this style of sushi. Miku is apparently well known for aburi sushi. I was a little disappointed after looking at their menu because they only had 3 choices for aburi sushi. We ordered salmon and saba aburi sushi from the aburi section of the menu. We also ordered unagi nigiri. Initially my wife and I thought that might not be enough for the two of us but we were wrong. All of our dishes were delicious and we especially like the unagi. However, the salmon and Saba aburi both came with a lot of rice on a very thin layer of meat. I think it could have been better had they reduced the amount of rice they serve for those two items.If you like aburi sushi just like me I'd suggest that you order from the nigiri section of the menu but ask for aburi style, which is a little extra but worth your penny since I think those offer a better balance between the meat and rice.",8/19/2018,4 star rating
145,Molly M.,"Reno, United States",I really wanted to live this place... we are on vacation and we are far from home and I love trying new places. We came between lunch and dinner and they offer a very limited menu.. we tried all of it and honestly it fell flat for me. Maybe I am used to the sushi from where I'm from with a big piece of fish atop some rice and I dip in my mixture of soy sauce and wasabi. This was a completely different style. One of my rolls looked like it had essence of fish but was a paste on rice? The reason I even gave it 4 stars is because of the desert. The green tea opera and vanilla ice cream were tasty pieces of art.,7/5/2019,4 star rating

As we were led to our table, everybody called out to welcome us. It gave off a very welcoming Japanese izakaya feeling. They were also very knowledgeable about all the food they were serving.The prices gave us pause, but the amount and quality of food was completely worth it.I was impressed already by the tuna tartar and braised beef. The sauce for the braised beef was unbelievable! I dipped some of my veggies into it too. Yum.Next came the sushi. The person who served it introduced each piece to us. We savored every piece.

148,Matt H.,"Philadelphia, United States","Overall a great restaurant - well known to natives and tourists alike. The professionalism of the staff, beautiful interior, and the sushi dishes (most of them) live up to expectations. The food itself runs the spectrum from very good to spectacular. For starters, I would go for the ebi fritters. I thought the batter was fried perfectly and the prawns were juicy. They drizzle some sweet chili aioli over to elevate the flavor too.For mains, we had the aburi prime (a packaged nigiri omakase) and the miku signature selection (a potpourri of aburi oshi sushi, specialty sushi, and other nigiri). The aburi prime is definitely worth it. There is some nice diversity of seafood (and one piece of wagyu) and each one of the nine pieces was delicious. Although I usually wolf down my food, I really slowed down and savored each piece. Each piece is also topped off with a little flower so the presentation was really beautiful.The miku signature selection was also good, but the only component that really stood out to me was the salmon oshi sushi. As other reviewers have pointed out, the salmon really does melt in your mouth like butter. Lastly, thanks to the restaurant for giving me and my wife seats with a nice view of the harbor!",7/2/2019,4 star rating

The aburi is a must! Nigiri is pricey but completely worth it, especially the wagyu. Rich and buttery with a slight sear to bring out the flavour. All other dishes are delicious and appealingly plated.The service is exemplary. We typically order a bottle of wine to share, and as soon as we take a sip, our server is there to top up our glass and ask if there's anything we need, but not in a hovering kind of way,This is one of our Vancouver go-to's and will remain so.",8/3/2019,5 star rating

I ended up ordering a scoop of ice cream after that, which came nicely garnished with berries, a cookie, and a bunch of other things.Service (1/1): Service was friendly and effective.

Too good to pass up, I must admit!TLDR; Leave your self respect at the door coz the hosts will likely be nasty to u (not sure if there is a race/ethnicity factor to it), enjoy the food and if ur lucky like me, u might get some fantastic service too.The Good: Food was just legendary and I can't oversell this one.. the Salmon Oshi was just made in heaven! Had the signature sushi plate which was pretty amazing as well.. the desert was pretty tasty too (green tea something..) I have a had a lot of Sushi but nothing like this! The service from Veronica and the crew has been commendable! Veronica is the greatest waitress of all time! And I don't say that lightly either.. she was really the best in many ways! (Management: Please give her a promotion or something)The Bad: The manager. I asked him to find out if there would be a table vacant with a good view a little later if I waited. He said he LL look into it and NEVER showed up!! Standard response would have been to get back to the customer and let them know the possibilities, needless to say. Would have given 4 stars if he had got back to me with a (any) response.The Ugly: The Hosting. I have experienced some bad hosting over time, but this one was just the WORST I have ever had.. If I weren't so hungry, I d have certainly walked away.. The hostess was rude and disrespectful both in her demeanor and verbal communication. I told the manager about that and he said he LL have a chat with her although he never asked me which one of hosts I was referring to. Guessing he may never have had that ""chat"" after all!

155,Rosemarie T.,"Vancouver, BC","My partner and I went here for dinner to celebrate our anniversary under his recommendation, no reservation. We were told that they only had the small menu at the time so he couldn't order all of what he originally wanted to get.The seaweed salad was decent, but not my cup of tea. There were a lot of new things I haven't tried before like having real seaweed and this root vegetable I can't name. This salad didn't come off as too amazing for me though. I eventually resorted to eating every other bite with an avocado bite as I wasn't particularly fond of the seaweed.The oshi sushi was phenomenal to my tastebuds. We had both the salmon and saba, it was hands down, the best sushi I've ever had. I especially enjoyed the salmon; it was deliciously creamy and the jalapeno gives it that extra pop of flavour.Would we come again? Of course!

156,Simon B.,"Vancouver, BC","Not remotely worth the price but if you have $200 to burn on dinner this is a place you can do that.Aburi is not my personal favorite. Searing sushi is an easy way to make it taste better to western palettes, in the same ballpark as our beloved mayo-filled dynamite and california rolls. The fish can be lower quality when it's masked with sauces and other flavors. It's debatably not even sushi at some point.But it IS delicious. And Miku made it locally famous.The 9 piece $60 Aburi omakase was indeed amazing, though it takes 2 or 3 to fill one person. Same with the $25 sashimi platter, in which some of the fish was decidedly a little off (including the salmon? how???). The only thing I had no argument with was the vegetable nigiri which used inventive sauces and was reasonably priced. I would come back for that.But if I get a hankering for aburi, I'll get it from one of the many other good sushi restaurants in Vancouver for a third the price.

It was visually stunning and the flavors sublime. I chose the flight of saki, which was a perfect pairing with the two rolls we chose. The Salmon Oshi Sushi, yummy and subtle in flavors. The second roll was the Red Wave Roll. Prawn and avocado. Probably of the two my favorite. We finished up with the Green Tea Opera, because, Abby said it was seminal, and who doesn't want that for dessert? And OMG again! The word that best describes this artwork is complex and brilliant. You won't likely recreate this at home, ever, so save room and have the experience.I throughly enjoyed our lunch and I imagine coming back on our next visit to Vancouver.

BUT the texture was not as melt in my mouth as I expected...maybe due to the fact that it was take-out perhaps?

159,G N.,"Vancouver, BC","Very disappointed in the service offered.  I had a discount code on UberEats that I used which I ordered 5 days in advance.  On the morning of, the order was still pending then 15 min before pick up it suddenly gets cancelled.  As in, right when Miku opened at noon they cancelled the order even though we placed it 5 days ahead of time.  We were already on our way so we went inside to ask and they basically just washed their hands of it.  ""It was Uber's fault for cancelling the orders.""  ""The promotion code was from UberEats and not us.""  Even after offering to pay in cash and waiting on the spot for them to honour the cancelled order, they said no.  Of course, UberEats was of no help either.  Essentially both are declining responsibility for this mess up.  If Miku isn't able to fulfill UberEats customer orders, don't advertise and use their platform.  If you do, suck it up and give the customer service your prices demands.  People pay a premium to eat at your establishment and even though we're doing pick up doesn't mean the service stops there.

There's no dress code per se but Miku says people feel most comfortable in business casual or smart casual. It is a classier, upscale place and I was happy to have worn a dress with a casual sweater. I did see others in dark jeans and running shoes that didn't look out of place. I was here by myself and was seated at the sushi bar right away around 6pm on a Wednesday. Drinks- OMG. Some of the best drinks I have ever had. I don't know what they do differently to their Mai Tai but it's next level. Also their Espresso martini SO GOOD. Must do! Oysters- So fresh. My mouth is watering. Sushi- I got the Chefs plate with an assortment. Their speciality is the Oshi Aburi sushi and you CANNOT, I repeat you CANNOT, leave here without trying it. IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. Was literally sitting at the bar having (multiple) sushi-gasms. My least favorite on the plate were the rolls. Next time I would stick with nigiri (which is usually my fave) and the Oshi Aburi. Watching the sushi chefs work was magical. I mean this is their art, and they took such great care in every single piece that was served. It was extremely obvious they take great pride in their work. Dessert- Green Tea Opera. Just wow. The Hazelnut wafer in the middle melts in your mouth. I also tried a seasonal cherry dessert. It was good in its own right, but preferred the Green Tea Opera. Service was impeccable.

I'm going with the final answer, but all the former are no less true. Miku is deserving of all praise that previous reviewers have given, and this review will probably echo previous descriptions and become buried in all other 5-star reviews.  As I have already indicated, the food was outstanding!  Miku served up the most flavorful sushi experience, transforming my previous conceptions and changing my understanding of what sushi is and should be.  Sushi does not need to be drown in soy sauce; in fact, no soy sauce or blobs of wasabi are served with your sushi meal!  The masterfully crafted meal is to be enjoyed as served.  So, enjoy and repeat as often as possible, my friends! Service is similarly impeccable. And, the water views are likewise exceptional.Pro tip: The restaurant is insanely popular (for the reasons outlined above), so I recommend an early lunch if you are trying to avoid the crowds.",3/29/2018,5 star rating

The staff was kind and attentive, formal without being to snobby. The restaurant itself was open, not too noisy, and bright. The sushi particularly their oshi, was the best sushi I've ever had and well worth the price. When in Vancouver, Miku should be your first stop!",12/27/2019,5 star rating
170,Jovie J.,"Vancouver, BC","I don't know what it is about this sushi that makes it the best I've ever had. We went here only to have the aburi salmon, and it never disappoints. The atmosphere is high end as soon as you come in you feel important and the prices show for it. The resto is perfectly nestled right beside the water too so you're also paying for the premium location. Is it worth it? Hell yah!!!! Nothing like I've tasted before and when you try it you'll see. You'll probably be eating Mr noodles for a week after you spend your pay check here but YOLO!",2/11/2020,5 star rating
171,Jason A.,"Nepean, Ottawa, ON","High end sushi place with a super clean and modern dining area overlooking the Vancouver harbour. Known for their Aburi sushi, this is a must try place when in downtown Vancouver. The direct entrance is up a flight up stairs. If coming with a stroller, the elevators are through the lobby or what appears to be an office building. We arrived on a Monday for lunch and the place was already super busy. Definitely make reservations in order to be seated right away.For lunch, we ordered two Lunch Shokai, an Ebi Oshi Sushi, and a Salmon Oshi Sushi for our party of 5. The Lunch Shokai was a perfect way to sample all their different sushi but can be pretty pricey at over $35. Out of the two Aburi Oshi sushi, we ended up preferring the ebi (shrimp) as it tasted less heavy than the sauce on the salmon. Both were still very good though!",8/7/2019,5 star rating
172,Mydien T.,"Riverdale, United States","This restaurant definitely have some of the best sushi I ever had! You can taste the incredibly fresh sushi. We were told this restaurant is usually packed and a reservation is definitely recommended. I was only visiting Vancouver for the weekend, but decided to just see if they can squeeze us in. We came right when they open and since it was only a party of 2, the staff was really accommodating and was able to seat us with just a 10 minute wait. But if you have a large party, highly recommend a reservation!The restaurant is gorgeous! It's clean and spacious. The staff of course was incredible. The menu was great. I thought the selection was terrific. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any choice on that menu. I love that you don't need any extra soy sauce with your sushi. The chef already made sure the flavor profile is there! I thought that was really phenomenal. I'm not a fan of sushi, but it was soo delicious. Yes it is pricey, but well worth it in my opinion. Parking - there's metered parking. There's also a parking deck close by. We went before 6pm so it cost us $17 (yikes!). Highly recommend!",5/14/2019,5 star rating

174,Paul A.,"Everett, United States","First, you have to know what you should expect.  This place is FUSION sushi.  So, it is not a traditional Japense sushi place.  You will probably will complain and won't like it if you expect something traditional. What do I mean by thatThe roll is not crafted by hand.  They use block.  So it comes out rectangular.  They make it like a production line.  Where the product go to each station with different process.  Unlike traditional sushi where each chef start and finish the product himself. There was a line when I go there.  They have a good system to manage the queue. The system will SMS you minutes before your table is ready. If you get table next to windows or outside balcony.  You will get great views of the ocean.   Keep some space for dessert and order green tea opera!",6/4/2018,5 star rating

182,Leena S.,"South Vancouver, Vancouver, BC","First off, I would like to say that Miku is my favourite restaurant and I always have a pleasant experience with both the food and staff. With that in mind my most recent experience was not up to par and had left me very unpleased given that I had booked the private room for my birthday celebration. Initially when we first ordered our drinks there was a long wait time. Several of our guests were not happy with the service they had received. When it came time to serve the food many of our guests were not receiving their food in a timely manner and were receiving their dishes well after the course had ended. Two of them in particular had received their entrees well after everyone had finished their food and there was no special instructions or anything done with their entree for them to receive it after everyone had already completed their dish. As this was a preset menu this was highly unacceptable and left my guests feeling very upset. On another note prior to booking with Miku I had advised that there would be 7 different bills as indicated in our previous email history. When it came time for the bills they had brought one bill and we had then asked for them to separate the bill as we had previously advised that there would be separate bills. The wait staff then become visibly upset and rude and advised that it would be an additional 20 minutes and we had then stated it would be fine. After a long wait time we had received our bills, settled them and left. All in all for having booked the private room with a preset menu at a high end restaurant, the food and service was not comparable to our experience and previous interactions with Miku.It's a shame because this used to be my favourite restaurant.",2/19/2018,1 star rating

Near the end of lunch service, at the end the servers weren't there as much, they were busy with our other conference crowd and local patrons that packed the entire restaurant the entire lunch.

185,Emily A.,"Mound, United States","First, I HATE giving places 1-2 stars. But I can't bring myself to go higher. For the price point, I definitely wouldn't go back nor recommend it (and that's with the current USD conversion rate). They have a special Miku Sauce that tastes like they torched Mayo on top of Sushi. We are from Minnesota and have had fresher better prepared sushi in a land locked state and we LOVE sushi. They pushed the Miku rolls so we got it and the miku sauce (mayo) just ruined the fresh fish. The Aburi (their specialty) tasted like greasy rice with raw fish and mayo torched over the top.  Yuck. When you have beautiful raw fish, why would you EVER put mayo on it!? Just don't understand the draw. The ONLY two things that was good were the service and the Miyazaki #2. There was nothing else that would ever make me recommend or go back for. Highly disappointing.",2/18/2018,1 star rating

187,James G.,"Oamaru, New Zealand","I texted a Canadian friend as I landed in Vancouver from New Zealand, and he immediately instructed me to eat at Miku on my arrival night. He has never steered me wrong (well, once) so I was sold, and made my way there for an earlyish dinner. It's a bit hard to find the door--it's not located on the street that is on the address, but around the corner--but it's very much worth your effort to get there.The room is large and cheerful, and though I thought I was going to be unfashionably early arriving at 6:30 on a Wednesday, the place was already pretty busy, but I was able to get a seat at the bar where a very friendly and helpful server looked after me. I had been advised to get the pressed sushi by my friend, but when I looked at the menu it seemed that it would be six pieces of the same thing, which did not grab me, especially since the choices were salmon (which I'm a bit bored of in NZ), prawn and something else. So instead I ordered the Aburi Prime moriawase, comprising nine pieces of nigiri sushi, each one different, and each very different from what you normally see. I then learned that they could do a half-order of the pressed sushi, so I added that to my order, as well as a 2/3 order of the tofu salad, which my friend also praised highly. And to wash it down, I opted for a flight of three sake tastes.Absolutely all of it was exceptional, from the sake, to the salad and especially to the sushi. The pressed sushi is definitely worth having--it consists of two layers of compressed sushi rice and raw local salmon, along with a torched kewpie mayonnaise topping. Absolutely delicious. And the sushi assortment comes with directions of which order to eat the items in. All of them were great, but I particularly liked the lobster, the wagyu beef and the yellowtail. And the tofu salad, which could have been rather boring, was anything but. I would definitely come back here (and may do so before I leave town). Give it a go!",6/5/2019,5 star rating
188,Oliver V.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, United States","Known for its pressed flames seared sushi (Alburi), Miku blends flavors, textures and fish freshness perfectly. Cocktails were on point too with impressive presentations. They have a variety of sake options but not as extensive as I expected (only one page) but as a consolation, they have wine and other liquors (ie shochu). Seating options include outdoor patio, table top by the sushi chefs and indoor. They have a retractable patio door too, which they closed during our dinner because it was getting uncomfortably breezy. Service was also spot on (thanks for closing the door when you noticed us shivering!). Our server explained the menu well and the sushi came out quickly. All-in-all, it was a great sushi meal.  I'd go back in a heartbeat too. I wouldn't mind trying the tasting menu with the sake pairing. That's a great idea because you get to know what you are getting without doing the deciding (vs asking for a sushi platter and not knowing what you will get, till it comes). The tasting menu also offers bites of filet mignon and a desert.",5/9/2019,5 star rating
189,Alexander Y.,"Rowland Heights, United States","Being American, I had to take advantage of that USD discount on all my purchases up here. Does that make me a jackass that I'm flagrantly taking advantage of my superior currency? Maybe it does...and I don't care! And that's how I ended up at Miku because I sure wanted some damn good sushi at a way cheaper price than I would get at home.Given the circumstances stated above, once I saw omakase on the menu it was a no-brainer what I was getting. Now, I can't really state what I had because I wasn't exactly taking notes on this (which I can't say I haven't done before :X). But my waitress went through all nine pieces of fish in full detail, including the garnishments! I was thoroughly impressed by her memorization. And yeah, the omakase was very good, one of the better ones I've had thus far. Wide variety of fish and fresh quality is always an instant win in my book.Also had to take advantage of some uni nigiri. THAT right there...wow, suuuuuper fresh. Definitely a fan of that right there.Service was beyond excellent on our end. My GF can't eat gluten, so our waitress painstakingly ensured that her order was gluten-free. Plus as I mentioned above, she did run down the entire omakase order without mistake. Definitely went above and beyond what I would've expected.As far as actually getting in here, don't bother without a reservation. This place is POPPING.Was very impressed with Miku.

195,John P.,"Fullerton, United States","Initial wait seemed a little disorganized when we checked in, even though we had a reservation. It seemed like the customers before us stayed longer than they intended. However, the customer service that they had when we started dining was exquisite. Really made it feel like a 5-star dining experience. The view of the inside was great and was very deceiving. Looks small when you get in, but when you continue walking down, you really notice how large it is. The seat I had had the view of the outside made it a great experience as well. Oysters: EXCELLENT. Well shucked. Very milky in taste. We had the Kusshi oysters, but it varies by season. The side sauces were very tasty and complimented the oyster very well. Very reasonably priced for the taste and the amount that we got. Miku roll:Very interesting in taste and DELICIOUS. Very much enjoyed this. The fish eggs were a good addition to the roll. The salmon was very fresh and melted in your mouth. Definitely recommend it!Chef select:Salad was very good, considering I don't eat salads haha. However; the miso soup was VERY refreshing. Heated at the right temperature, and it just went right through. Amazing taste. The wait between receiving the soup and salad and getting the rest of the meal is a little long. We waited about 15 minutes after the appetizer and the soup/salad to receive it. They did give us a little small side dish as a complimentary dish since they did admit the kitchen was really backed up. But, when the food came. Wow... amazing presentation. The server explained each of the selection to us and it was amazing. Definitely was worth the wait and you can tell the work that was put into it. Very reasonably priced. Definitely recommend people to eat here!",3/23/2019,5 star rating

The first time I went here the waitress suggested the Salmon Oshi Sushi and I'm not a salmon fan but I must admit it was really good and I was an immediate fan. Very creamy and delicious. The oysters were meh but the steak made up for it. I usually get the steak done medium and it was so juicy and marinated very well. I went on New Year's Eve the second time without a reservation and had to wait an hour but it was so worth it. I was even surprised that they were able to take us in without a reservation.

199,Sukh R.,"Vancouver, BC","I was taken here for a late birthday dinner by a good friend.  Unfortunately I made reso on the wrong day again and the wait was very long.  It was very busy even on a week night.  So they seated me at a bar seat and said they had nothing else, and when I asked to wait for a table seat they said it would be another 45 mins.  To which I asked ""So the people being seated right after me are going to wait 45 mins for a seat?""  If i was waiting first and want to wait a bit longer for a table, it should not take ANOTHER 45 mins.  So the hostess went back to her team and then seated me at a table! The girl I spoke to was nice, just the hostess team I found a little, clueless.  Sorry, but maybe they should find another vocation that doesn't involve time or math. Lol. That is the only reason this isn't a five out of five.Anyways, on the the rest of the review!  We ordered a sushi sampling plate, which was pretty great.  I loved being able to sample a few of the rolls.  There was one I particularly loved but didn't catch the name.  My apologies yelpers, i dropped the ball! lol The ambiance was beautiful, although i didn't have a view of the water, it was very elegant inside and I liked the wall art.  My waitress was great, very friendly and accommodating.  She was great at explaining everything on our plate.  I would def go back with a proper reservation, because the wait is ridiculous and I'm not keen about sitting at the bar to eat sushi.",1/17/2018,4 star rating
200,Sheri S.,"Bellingham, United States","Five big stars! I am used to wonderful sushi experiences. I was so excited to take a little road trip to Vancouver BC and experience Miku. I was happy and impressed beyond. I like nigari sushi, but would love just having sashimi more if it weren't so fast to devour and then rack up your bill. So I ended up getting nigari as usual. I was really pleased to see that the rice portion was small--so a perfect compromise! And I never put wasabi in my soy  to dip in as usually there is so much on the fish. Miku was a lovely combination of just the right amount of rice--and delicately seasoned with rice wine vinegar and the barest amount of wholly flavorful wasabi. It was perfection! And this is even before I get to talking about the fish and their preparations! Lovely! Delectable! And I wasn't as interested in their other more meat-based offerings until my friend, Suzannah, gave me bites of hers. OMG delicious. I could actually eat here without eating fish and still have a fabulous meal. Our waiter, Shuhei, was sweet, accommodating, good humored, informative and nice as he could be. Lovely experience in all ways. In case I am not clear about this, the sushi was fabulous!",1/14/2019,5 star rating
201,Yushan C.,"Seattle, United States","For Asian, I suggest Miku as a 3 stars restaurant. For local American or Canadian, 4 stars is the max. The environment is good and clean. However, sushi here are designed for local, not authentic and traditional at all. 1. Fish are not fresh. This is the number 1 key for sushi, and aburi with strong &creamy sauce does not cover the bad fishy flavor. Seafood must be FRESH! 2. They use very poor quality of rice and did not cook it appropriately, the sushi rice taste like over night ref-ridged rice for cooking fried rice.For their sushi, I will give only 2 stars max. But, one beef tender from the Miku zen dishes is TOO good which I wanna give 6 stars for that single dish. And, their do have 5 stars dessert. So, 4 stars is my final decision to balance btw good and bad.",1/19/2019,4 star rating
202,Justin N.,"Austin, United States","The food here was spectacular. I did not have a bad dish. The calamari was probably the best i have ever had. The service is hit or miss. Overall the staff is friendly but there seems to be a little bit of a condescending attitude if you dont eat the food exactly the way they want you to. Meaning, if you ask for soy sauce and the chef did not intend for the dish to have it, you get looks. This place is also very pricy. At least where i am from, for $100 i will leave very full. You will spend about $20 a roll and more for the sashimi. Again, every bite was delicious. But, you might get more for your buck at other places.

203,Issabelle F.,"Vancouver, BC","4 stars for delicious sushi and a view. I had just spent the day at a conference at the Convention Centre and was on my way to the skytrain when Miku caught my eye. I had been here before and had been impressed by their dinner menu back then, so decided to walk in for a mid-day snack. I was dining alone so I grabbed a seat at the end of the bar. That way I was still able to look out at the water. It wasn't busy, there were plenty of tables open, but recently I've had a thing for sitting at the bars and chatting with my neighbours. Don't judge me. They were only serving their small menu when I came in this time, which consisted of appetizers and two main sushi dishes. I was a little disappointed, but that was my fault for coming in between their lunch and dinner menus. I ended up getting the brussel sprouts chips and king sushi (crab, avocado, tempura, chipotle) and a glass of white wine. Their serving portion was a little bit smaller than what I would get at another restaurant, but nonetheless still yummy. I was blown away by the brussel sprouts, to be honest. I have never really been a fan of brussel sprouts but I've recently been trying to get into them and Miku's variety has won me over. It was perfectly salty with a little bit of spice, which I loved. I didn't think I'd be able to finish the whole bowl, but I did. It was that good. Service was a little bit on the slower end, but still very very friendly. Like I said I came in during a weird time between lunch and dinner, so their serving staff was transitioning from day to night as well. That didn't bother me though. I was happily enjoying my brussel sprouts and glass of wine. Also, as I typed that last sentence I felt about 30 years older than I am. I had a great conversation with the night bartender when he started his shift since he took care of me the rest of my time there. Also, when your food is delivered to you, one of the chefs comes over to describe what you're eating. Which is really helpful if you're ordering different types of sushi. I will definitely be back to enjoy their dinner menu again.",11/23/2017,4 star rating
204,Avery W.,Hong Kong,"Miku is a place that I've been to twice, and even though it's edging towards the expensive end of the spectrum, I'd still come again.I first came to Miku on a whim when while I was looking for restaurants that could potentially impress some family friends. While I couldn't book this place for such occasions, I have been able to eat at this place with two massive sushi fans, and overall, I could probably sum it up quite plainly as both guests falling in love with this place.The aburi salmon seems to be the most popular thing on both occasions since there is this very pleasant smoothness and fragrance on the top layer of the Miku roll. Ebi fritters are a fantastic start to the meal, thanks to the creamy and mild chipotle mayo that it is served with, and the remarkable freshness of the shrimp, where there a satisfying, almost crisp texture to the shrimp (following the batter). On top of that, the batter itself was also very light.Miku is best known for its Aburi, so of course we had to order some of that, and what we got were the salmon oshi sushi and the ebi (shrimp) oshi sushi. I generally preferred the ebi oshi sushi this time around because it had a very pleasant range of textures. The ebi oshi had this really soft and chewy texture that I felt really went with the pressed rice, and it also captured the fresh, almost sweet flavour of the shrimp, while also allowing the texture to complement the creaminess of the sauces that it was served with. The salmon oshi sushi was also a sensory experience to behold, since the salmon is still very fragrant while the jalapeños add a bit of a kick to it.If I'm eating with someone and it's over a special occasion, I wouldn't hesitate to pick this place.",3/9/2018,5 star rating

I love their cocktails especially the fruity ones!  I know we ordered some mussels, some assorted sashimi, scallops, and some of their specials they were recommending. I'd order everything again in a heart beat. The place isn't cheap but it's really good and it's definitely worth it if you love seafood.

206,Anna B.,"Los Angeles, United States","Make reservations because this place gets jam packed and for good reason too. I've had sushi at a lot of places but I've never had a charbroiled one before. They explained the science behind it, but I was too tipsy to remember now. A local recommended Miku sushi so my friend and I decided to try it out. It's a little hard to find but with a little help from a kind Canadian on the street we were able to locate it. We got lucky enough to snatch some seats at the sushi bar and we got a first row seat on how they made their unique sushi. We started off with the Miyazaki #2 drink and some Brussel sprouts. The came the prawns, a chiefs choice sashimi platter and the infamous salmon Oshi sushi. The drink was really good, not sure if I'm just used to the weak drinks we get in Los Angeles but one drink was sufficient. The Brussel sprouts were Brussel sprouts nothing amazing but nothing terrible. The sashimi is probably the best in Canada. Very fresh and tasty. The salmon oshi sushi is definitely something I've never had before. They glaze the rice with mayo and charbroiled it. I like the taste of charcoal so it was amazing to me. Kinda like a bbq-ed sushi. For the grand finale' we got the Green tea opera, which takes about 72 hours to make. It was worth every calorie. We devoured our whole meal.",9/8/2019,5 star rating

208,Carrie W.,"San Francisco, United States","This was easily one of the best meals we had on our recent trip to Vancouver. I made a reservation for lunch here on the recommendation of our tour guide and we were really happy I did. A and I had never had Aburi sushi but were really intrigued so decided to give it a go. As soon as we walked in for our reservation, we were greeted by everyone in the kitchen (which was huge and open) and led to a window in the back of the restaurant which had a beautiful view of Canada Place and the harbor. The restaurant itself is also beautiful and very bright on the inside, especially with the sunshine.Both A and I decided to do lunch sets so we could try a wide variety of everything. Compared to the dinner prices, the lunch prices are not too bad so I recommend coming for lunch. - Chef's Select ($39) - This is what A got and it came with 12 pieces of sushi selected by the chef (a mix of rolls, aburi sushi and Nigiri) as well as a miso soup and their tofu salad. This plate was beautiful and A was really happy with the quality of food and the variety.-Miku Zen ($35) - This is what I got and I loved it! It was 4 non-sushi small dishes, 5 pieces of aburi sushi and miso soup. This was a lot of food and A had to help me out. Everything I had was really good and I loved the chance to try a bunch of different things. The presentation was also beautiful. The aburi sushi was the highlight.In addition to our meal, I ordered a green tea and the very attentive wait staff kept refilling my tea and the teapot itself with hot water. The tea was also delicious! I know it's so simple but during the cold Vancouver day, it really hit the spot.The service was also fantastic. Our server (I didn't catch her name) was so attentive and enthusiastic. She also took the time to explain everything that we were being served which with the variety we had must be a ton of knowledge. The whole staff was on top of refilling water and tea and making sure we always had what we needed. Seriously, top notch across the board.I would absolutely come back for lunch or even dinner now that I know it's worth it next time we are in Vancouver. You cannot go wrong here. Our food was so unique, fresh and delicious and the meal was a great experience.",11/29/2018,5 star rating
209,Gervis ..,"Burnaby, BC",One of best sushi restaurants in Vancouver.  Been here 1/2 dozen times and the food is very good.  Better than their sister restaurant in Yaletown.  It is pricy but not much different than some of the nice small sushi bars.  Gets very busy so I wouldn't go there without reservations.,12/28/2020,5 star rating
210,Adani C.,"Tacoma, United States",Must try the Aburi Prime. Yes it's really expensive for each piece has different taste and it will melt in your mouth. You deserve to be spoiled once in a while.Service is great as well. Will definitely return when I'm in town!,3/25/2019,5 star rating
211,Hanna M.,"Surrey, BC","There is a lot of great Japanese food in Vancouver. Miku is definitely on my top 5 spots for aburi in Vancouver. The salmon aburi is super delicious here. But my absolute favourite thing about Miku is the seafood that they have. They have seafood boards that are so fresh and delicious its hard to even compare it to anything else you've tasted before. This is not cheap sushi (Vancouver has that as well) but it is some the absolute best. If you can afford it, enjoy the kaiseki menu and sample the very best!",6/19/2019,5 star rating
212,Luka J.,"Central Vancouver, Vancouver, BC",Miku is one of my all time favourite restaurants in Vancouver. The tuna sashimi tastes fresh and melts in your mouth. Another amazing dish is the Miku roll which has fish eggs rapping the rice with a secret sauce that is lightly seared on top. The environment of the restaurant is clean with a nice ocean view. On the patio there are blankets to keep you warm on cool days. One of the only problems is the price which can easily dent your credit card even if you only order a couple dishes. Overall I definitely suggest coming to Miku if you are visiting or living in Vancouver.,9/3/2019,5 star rating

214,Joy W.,"San Francisco, United States","Miku specializes in aburi style sushi, which apparently is nigiri with the fish grilled topside or lightly seared. Eating sushi while looking out on the water sounded delightful to me, so I made a reservation to give Miku a try. Upon walking in, you see a bar arranged like an island and a sushi bar to the right. Then there's a series of tables lined up by the window overlooking the ocean, a bunch of booths on the other side, and there's a large banquet table in the back for large parties. Besides the bathroom being on the messy side, the venue was very attractive. We were seated in a comfy booth and our waitress went over the Kaiseki menu. I believe we went with the Shokai Kaiseki and started off with a couple of cocktails.Shokai - $68; zensai, entree, signature sushi, dessertKaisen - $88; 6 coursesAburi - $135$14 Nightshade - dragon fruit liquor, yuzu, vanilla extract, house blend of bitters, egg white:a beautiful cocktail with dark blue swirls on top of the egg white, tastes a little like a Pisco sour with a nice kick$14 Shiso Mojito - tantakatan Japanese shochu, shiso, lime, sparking water:a rather mild mojito, not too strong, and not too mintySashimi Selection - scallop, beef, tuna & salmon:This plate included a single seared jumbo scallop with caramelized onions on top, seared beef skewer that resembled and tasted like roast beef over a vegetable shooter, a bite of tuna, and a bite of sockeye salmon with some micro greens.Kyoto Saikyo Miso Baked Sablefish - kale goma-ae, yuzu miso reduction:very silky, creamy sablefish w/ textured kale, a single shishito pepper, a sweet potato chip, and micro greensAAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib - 10 oz, 5 hr sous-vide, brown butter wasabi sauce, market vegetables, iwa-nori butter yukon potato puree:For a multi-course meal, the prime rib was a very nice size. It had a thick vein of fat running through it. It was accompanied with a halved carrot, a meaty mushroom, yellow zucchini, and creamy potatoes. I could have done without the prime rib, actually.Miku Signature Sushi - white tuna & scallop aburi, tuna rolls, aburi oshi salmon & ebi aburi:This was probably my favorite plate of the meal. Every roll was just barely cooked, lightly seared or broiled on top. The scallops were very sweet and juicy. The aburi oshi salmon and ebi aburi were creamier than I expected. Dessert:The meal concluded with a serving of tiramisu topped with a halved cherry, a scoop of ice cream, fruit compote, and a caramelized sugar crisp. I love tiramisu, and this was an alright one, not amazing, not bad.Overall, dinner tasted pretty good and service was great. I enjoyed the aburi sushi, but I'm usually more of a sashimi or regular nigiri person, so I'm not sure if I'd be too eager to make a return visit, but if I do return one day, I'd love to try other cocktails.",10/7/2017,4 star rating
215,Bugsy J.,"Long Beach, United States",Enjoyed my dinner here especially the Aburi ebi & salmon oshi. It's obviously on the pricier side but I'd say well worth it. Almost forgot to add how good the Kaiso seaweed salad is. I'd definitely go back!,5/25/2020,4 star rating

218,Cristalle L.,"Vancouver, BC","Finally tried Miku out for my birthday dinner and to be honest I wasn't too impressed although I really, really wanted to be. My boyfriend had made the reso and noted that it was a birthday celebration; when we arrived, not only did we still have to wait a while, there was also no mention of the occasion. Not too deterred, we were seated by the window which gave us a nice waterfront view. I didn't realize how lively and bustling Miku was; for some reason I had envisioned an intimate atmosphere but it was almost borderline too loud for my liking. We ordered some oshi sushi, calamari and nigiri - we really wanted the toro but at 5:30pm, they were already sold out... unfortunately this dampened our mood and that's how the rest of the night went. The food was good (calamari was so delicately deep fried and the dipping sauce was delicious) and the oshi really exemplified why every other sushi restaurant was imitating Miku's oshi. I think I would give Miku another chance, just because I feel like with the amount of rave reviews Miku receives all the time, our experience was hopefully just an anomaly.",8/10/2019,3 star rating
219,Helen z.,"San Francisco, United States",Wow this place is fantastic! I would highly recommend the chef's tasting because you won't regret it! The nine pieces of nigiri are so fresh and unique. Not to mention the service where they are so kind and cater to your every need. I also recommend the green tea dessert and the assorted sorbets because they are made in house and have very unique flavors. I will definitely be coming back if I visit Vancouver!,1/12/2018,5 star rating
220,V T.,"Los Angeles, United States","We tried the 9 piece omakase. Though it was not the best sushi I've had (I am a picky sushi eater), I felt the price tag (58 CND) was fair and customer service was pretty good. The 9 pieces were organized from light flavoring to rich. I would've preferred a bolder flavoring (hence an one star deduction). Afterwards, we felt that we could still eat more, so ordered a miso soup and salmon roll. The salmon roll was surprisingly great. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking safe sushi options with modern and hip ambiance.",8/5/2019,4 star rating
221,Michael C.,"San Francisco, United States","This place is truly deserving for all it's awards won. Definitely one of the top restaurants in Vancouver and a highlight of our trip. They are known for their aburi sushi, which translates to ""flame seared"". Their aburi sushi is amazing. It's like a little piece of heaven in your mouth. Have you ever had a mouthgasm? If not, come here and experience one!Do you want to be disappointed with all other sushi you've had in your life? Well, definitely visit this place!Do you want to put a piece of sushi in your mouth, have it melt, and leave you wondering you even ate it in the first place? Come to this restaurant to experience that! Their service is excellent. Pretty much 2 waiter per table to tend to your every need. I love how they take reservations. The location is amazing. Right by the water. They also gave us a dessert for our anniversary. To be honest, I'd probably move to Vancouver so I can have this on a weekly basis.",2/17/2019,5 star rating
222,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, United States","My friend took me here when I visited Vancouver and it was a great experience! The restaurant itself is slightly hard to find, but once you're there, you'll enjoy the slightly overdone decor typical of an Asian fusion restaurant and the gorgeous view of the water.We came here for lunch and both got the lunch omakase. It includes a quartet of appetizers, a salad, a variety of nigiri sushi, and dessert. I can't say it was the best and most authentic sushi I've ever had. Well, of course not, this is a fusion place. But it was still quite delicious. The individual appetizers had unique flavors and the fusion sushi was done well - interesting toppings or sauces or garnishes for each.Highly recommend if you're trying to impress somebody!",1/8/2018,4 star rating
223,Jenny G.,"San Diego, United States",I have made sure to eat at Miku on both my trips to Vancouver this year. The restaurant specializes in a torched sushi that is absolutely mouth-watering and addictive. It is located right on the waterfront and has beautiful views. Sit outside for the best vibe.

224,Sahar J.,"West Vancouver, BC",I had the albacore belly sashimi along with the salmon oshi sushi. Both were pretty amazing. The oshi sushi was very unique and would recommend getting it. The albacore sashimi just melted in my mouth. Was (I believe) the best sushi overall that I have ever had. Definitely recommend it if you are in the neighborhood (also apparently most sushi in Vancouver is better than great sushi in other cities).,12/28/2018,5 star rating
225,Eric C.,"Fremont, United States","The square sushi (Oshi) that everyone recommends is really really good and unique. I would recommend just ordering that. I sat at the bar and loads of people were ordering just that. I had a chefs selection with an assortment of nigiri, and I would say the rest of the sushi compared to the oshi ones is sub par, especially compared to other places that you can get nigiri. Still delicious but not the best sushi. (This is in reference to sushi spots in California). Overall ambience is great, servers were really nice :) Would be back again if I ever come back to Vancouver.",3/16/2019,5 star rating

Different layers of yummy goodness and surprisingly filling.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals, one complain was several of the sushi might have had too much wasabi but generally everyone loved the food.  Vancouver has a lot of sushi places Miku is one of more ""fancier also pricier"" places, so I wont come often but I will be back!",9/8/2017,5 star rating

Our favorite was the prawn aburi oshi! Also they have a tasting ""flight"" of sake which is a great way to try 3 different types of sake.

The food overall was quite good but definitely doesn't warrant the high price levels. Rice was cold instead of being warm at other comparable sushi restaurants I had been to.

235,Michelle T.,"Irvine, United States","Miku was highly recommended by friends who have visited as well as Yelp as it was the #1 choice when I typed in sushi for Vancouver. My friends and I came from California to visit Vancouver and constantly heard about all the amazing sushi there is. So I knew I had to try the best joint around.The verdict? It was absolutely splendid and I'm so glad we made the visit.The ambiance is sophisticated and modern. We were able to sit by the view that shows the harbor near Canada Place. It was such a great addition to our night. The service is extremely attentive and they will also clear your plates between rolls to give you a new plate which is quite nice. One tip is to be sure to make a reservation a few days in advance to secure a good time/day that works for you. They are always busy and you'll see why after you try their food. Their sushi was exquisite as it was full of flavor in every bite and they also had very different rolls. My favorite? The oshi sushi is to die for.  I would go all the back to Canada to eat some more of it, it's that good. Their sashimi was in smaller portions but it was still very delicious and it came in such a beautiful arrangement with seaweed as well. We also had the ebi fritters that were quite tasty with the perfect crunch, sauce, and they came in large portions as well.Overall, I really have nothing bad to say about Miku. I am extremely glad we made this restaurant our final stop before heading out of Vancouver. It is well worth the visit if you are in town!!",9/28/2018,5 star rating
236,Brian L.,"San Francisco, United States","Heard great things about Miku and it does NOT disappoint! Made a dinner reservation for 2 on Opentable. (3/23/19)Our server was very positive and answered all our questions as first timers--going as far to recommend which fish would go best with the regular or sweet soy sauce. We were sold on: Ebi fritters - delectable beer battered shrimp  (pleasantly surprised when they offered to add on an extra shrimp so our party of 2 wouldn't have to fight over the remaining fifth shrimp). Sashimi platter - 25/person; fish is chef's choice. Take the chance to add on otoro (prized cut of tuna belly) for extra $$. Unbelievably fresh and well presented. They even offered to fry the amaebi/spot prawn head and it was an interesting bite haha. Fan favorite though would be the kaisen mini poke bowl! 1/2 Miku Roll + 1/2 Salmon Oshi - The signature Miku Roll was a solid salmon and crab roll! The salmon oshi was creamy and a must try! Aburi Prime - splurged on this omakase 9 piece nigiri and did not regret! Each successive nigiri intensified in flavor and all the garnishes were edible. It almost looked too good to eat. It was so good that we went back for lunch and I had to get the sashimi (lunch) again! This time though, I opted for dessert, Yuzu Mango Chiboust! 'Twas an interesting play of Japanese and European flavors, full of citrusy goodness. Next time, I'll try the Green Tea Opera Cake.",4/1/2019,5 star rating
237,Lim T.,"Markham, ON","Enjoyed a fabulous dinner!  We were here visiting Vancouver for a week and I had to include a visit to Miku given that it's one of my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto.The menu was pretty similar so I knew exactly what I wanted to order.   Must get the Miso Baked Sablefish!  I wanted to compare it to Toronto and it tasted just as good.   At least I know now that the Miku in Toronto has the exact same quality standard as the original location.  With 8 of us, I was able to order more dishes including the Aburi lobster tail and the Prime Rib.  These were delicious especially the prime rib.  I know what I'll be ordering next time when I'm at Miku Toronto.  We also got some Aburi sushi - the Salmon Oshi Sushi is a must.The service was impeccable.  From beginning to end, the server was very attentive and helpful.  I ordered a bowl of rice for my dad and I was a little surprised that it came out right away before the food was served.  He explained that it was sushi rice and it was in room temperature which is why they brought it out already.  He offered to warm it for him when the food came out even though it was a strange request but he didn't hesitate.The place was gorgeous by the harbour.  I highly recommend that you make reservations for a table at the window with the water view.  Since we needed a bigger table, we can only get a table that has the water view but not next to the window but it was still very nice.Overall, we had a great evening and would love to come back if we visit Vancouver again.",9/2/2017,5 star rating

All the sushi already had very flavorful sauce on it so no need to add soy sauce. Chirashi tart - Beautiful work of art that packed rice, avocado, fish, and sauces together.

Came here on a whim for lunch and got there just about half hour after opening and it was on New Year's Eve day. All tables were booked, so the host put us on the wait list and said it would be about 40 minutes. About 15 minutes later they got us in luckily!Service was great our waiter was very patient and explain to us what the dishes were when we asked. Upon being served we were also given an explanation of what every single piece of sushi was and where it was sourced. We decided to get every course, from appetizers, entree and dessert!We got the Ebi Fritters which was perfectly cooked and the shrimp was sweet as ebi should be, it went well with the salad and dressing. As for the entree between two people we got the Traditional omakase sushi lunch which was great and no need for any soy sauce or wasabi since it's the the sushi is already prepared with it. Which is what high quality sushi place prepares their sushi. Along with that we got the Aburi Chirashi Tart which was larger and denser than we expected. It's layered with different types of fish and flavors. Definitely something I haven't had before and recommend here. As for dessert we got the Green Tea Opera, we typically don't like chocolates but this also have so many layers of flavors and texture that the chocolate went so well with everything.The view is one the nicest I've been to in Vancouver right at the waterfront for a restaurant.

However, for those who love wasabi...this is your dish!I however, strongly recommend the signature selection! Everything was super tasty and has that melts in your mouth type feel! I love all the oshis and that was very worth its cost! I'm only rating this based on personal preference to the wasabi!

Without going into too much detail, every dish was unique in its own way as the restaurant does not serve soy sauce and wasabi since it's not needed. The most signature dish here was the salmon oshi.

I went all out for lunch:-Nightshade (cocktail, $14): Such a beautiful cocktail! The egg white made it frothy and smooth, but it was ever so sweet, a little citrusy, and slightly bitter.-Aburi Chirashi Tart ($24): The layering on this made for another well-presented, gorgeous dish. Seafood was fresh to death and the transition of textures was just dizzying. -Salmon Oshi Salmon ($17): This is what they are known for -- sushi prepared with a flame seared technique with the addition of their signature sauces. I have to admit, I was initially very satisfied with these pieces, but once it settled in that I was eating mostly mayo I became less so. The sear just did not give me that promised smokeyness either. So the top layer is seared MAYO with a jalapeno on top. Then underneath that is salmon, a TON of rice, a little more salmon, and EVEN MORE rice. A small offering of fish. They really need to sear the fish on TOP instead. -Albacore Toro Nigiri ($4, one piece): Albacore belly! And a part of their sustainable seafood offering! If I couldn't have Otoro I just had to have this and Mr. Jason H. gave me a heart attack when he said it might be out... but then returned with good news saying they still had it! Hooray. Finely cut, perfectly juicy, and just so luscious! The amount of wasabi inside was just enough to give you a pop of burn. The sauce on top was a tantalizing addition! -Green Tea Opera Cake ($14.50): a layered medley of green tea grenoise, matcha butter cream, dark chocolate ganache, azuki bean cream, and hazelnut wafer. Not only a pretty dessert! This thing is so immensely rich, wonderfully textured, and just a journey! Green tea ice cream on the side was icing on the cake for me! We kept trying to guess what the yellowed ball of something in the leaf was... apparently it was a gooseberry!My friend also ordered the *Premium Sushi Lunch* ($29) which is a solid option if you don't want to spend around like me. You get an assortment of nigiri, 2 oshi pieces, and some rolls. It even included two pieces of their *red wave roll*. To be honest, it was pretty generic, so if you want to avoid ordering the whole roll, the premium is the way to go to sample some of it. I went off on a long-winded review... probably the hottest restaurant in Vancouver and recommended! It's even affordable so long as you don't go crazy like me. :D",7/30/2018,4 star rating

You're paying for the status of dining here, more so than the quality of the food or the service.If you want to entertain business guests or tourists, and you want to showcase the local seafood, which means an expensive steakhouse is not the right place, then sure you can take them here (or go to bluewater).However, if you're a local, then you need to get passed this place.",11/15/2017,3 star rating

We ordered the Seafood Platter and Fritters for our appetizers. Then we ordered their 10 year anniversary menu and everything was phenomenal. The service was great! The servers knew their information. They asked if any of us had allergies and after we told them that some of us did have allergies, they were very cautious and every time they came by our table with foods, they mentioned how they didn't put this, this, and that in any of the foods. MAKE SURE TO MAKE A RESERVATION THOUGH! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!! :)",10/23/2018,5 star rating

I havent seen aburi style elsewhere.Yes it's on the pricier side but I thought it was worth the pretty penny not just for solid food but also great service at a beautiful location. You get what you pay for.  For a light lunch, we tried the premium sushi special, Zen special, half order of the salmon aburi, and the green tea opera cake dessert. If I could change anything I probably would get more salmon aburi or sashimi rather than the variety set. Finally it was my sister's birthday so they were more than happy to personalize the dessert and top it with a candle. (No comp though)",8/29/2017,5 star rating
251,Layne C.,"New York, United States","I have been called a sushi snob. I whole heartedly agree. I am. I want amazing, mouth watering, fresh and tasty sushi. I don't care for trends and I am one of the few that absolutely despises Uni. So if you think you are going to get a raving Uni review, you won't. I am obsessed with sushi and if there is only one thing I can eat for the rest of my life, it will be sushi. Dramatic, but true. Every time I travel to a new country, state and city, I always look for their best sushi places and after scouring the internet - thank you YELP - we finally decided to check out Miku and I am soo soo happy with did. I always question restaurants that are in high tourist area, are you actually decent or are you just banking on tourists that will pay the high price for mediocre foods? I live in NYC and Time Square is known for this exploitation and it's pathetic. Canada Place may not be Time Square, but it's definitely a busy spot that attracts people to visit. So now that I am done with my small talk, let's get to the food. We didn't have reservations and there was a 45+ minutes wait for a table for two, but we could sit at the bar immediately. I tend to shy away from the bar, because I am a bit handicapped and sitting on a high top chair is painful. I didn't want to wait 45 minutes, so we took it and it turned out great. Our bartender was amazing and knowledgeable and only provided us with great insight on the wine and food. We ordered a bottle of Pinot Gris and he happily made sure that we are ok with the fact that it is off-colored. No one ever asked us if we mind. We tend to warn our wait staff when we go eat sushi, that we are a gluttonous bunch. We gave him our order and he, again, made a suggestion that based on our order and the fact that Miku is known for their Aburi style sushi that we should try their chef's omakese and their Aburi specials. I was a little hesitant, because I hate uni and I will not want to waste a piece and so far, no place, has ever accepted a substitution for uni - so they will never have me order from them. But when he told us there will be no uni and I never tried omakese before, we decided to go for it. We took his suggestions a 100% and we were not sorry. I wish I remembered his name. Every piece was delicious and just melt in your mouth. The chef's selection and how he paired each piece with its garnish was out of this world. I could have kept ordering. Now to the Aburi style sushi. I was hesitant. I really do love me some raw sushi and the idea that you flame torch cook the sushi made me cringe, but let me assure you that you need to try it. It's not a replacement for sushi, but it's an amazing addition to your palate that you will thank me for later. Please do yourself a favor and check this place out. I am not the best to describe each piece to you, so I am going to tell you that you need to get your behind over there and try their food. They have a few restaurants that are affiliated and have the same style, like Minami. I wanted to go back to Miku, but we decided to try their style as well. I prefer Miku - the original - but you still can't go wrong with Minami, they have a lot of the same items on the menu but more limited. You're welcome!",10/3/2019,5 star rating
252,Sarah L.,"Seattle, United States","If you are ever in Vancouver or love Japanese food I 10/10 recommend this place! My mother & I were visiting Vancouver from Seattle a few months ago and we decided to try this place. The experience was phenomenal. The hostesses were very sweet and informative and our server was a delight; since it was our first time she made sure to give the best recommendations and break down the menu. We decided to sit outside on the deck since it was a nice day out and the view was too nice to miss out on. To start, we ordered a Miyazaki #2 and an Aperol Spritz to drink and Calamari and Ebi Fritters for an appetizer. The drinks were so refreshing and the appetizers were fried to perfection. For our main course, based on our waiter's recommendation, we ordered the Salmon Oshi Sushi and the Red Wave Roll. It was exquisite. They were both flavorful, refined, and fresh while also still delicate. Simply outstanding. To finish, we ordered the Green Tea Opera and a Seasonal Dessert. They were both a feast for our eyes and our palettes. The pairings of chocolate and fruit was amazing. Every bite was to die for. On top of that, they provided blankets at every table outside since it can get a little chilly, especially after the sun sets.  This experience was a memorable one and worth every penny! I will definitely be returning when I am in town.",8/8/2019,5 star rating
253,Imran N.,"Toronto, ON","I'm really pleased with Miku. They've managed to capture a niche in the market place that I really appreciate, and you find in other parts of the world, but not necessarily often in Canada. There's always been a challenge in being able to find good sushi joint (that's not a 10 person seater), at a place that you can comfortably spend hours drinking and eating at.  Miku delivers very strong with location, service, and food. I have to say, that I received some of the most effective service I have in a while, in that it was relaxed and professional, yet very detailed. The menu is excellent and I love that they have such a strong focus on the best. The Aburi menu is by far the more superior choice than their roll menu in terms of their specialties.  Looking forward to many more visits.",10/10/2018,4 star rating

We started with Calamari which was very delicious. We ordered the Premium platter, an amazing assortment of their best sushi. We also ordered the Baked Sablefish which was a very delicious fish cooked just perfectly. Perfect for those who do not like sushi. Make room for dessert because they have 2 delicious choices: Earl Grey Valrhona Chocolate Ganache and their Vanilla Almond Cream. I really loved the Vanilla Almond Cream option since it wasn't too filling but it was very delicious.

263,Smitcha B.,"Los Angeles, United States","Michael Jordan has multiple clutch game winning moments in the history of the NBA. Recently, Jordan Spieth just had a clutch final 5 holes to win the British Open after a potential disaster on hole 13 of his final round. Lenny, our waiter for the night was Miku's clutch. Kudos to him (and the rest of the staff) for being helpful and informative throughout our experience. What I get about Miku... make reservations. The joint isn't big, so call ahead of time if you can. The location is money, you can potentially have a nice view of Canada Place and the port of Vancity. If you reserve, you can even request a window or balcony table to enjoy the view. We got a nice booth to ourselves and a clear view of the Five Sails and the port. Because the location is hot and the restaurant is modern, clean, and classy, expect a hefty bill at the end of the night.You may potentially go home hungry. We knew this fact beforehand. Sounds like typical cliché Los Angeles fine dining. Pay a lot but receive minimal amount of food. Their bomb green tea opera dessert, $14 CAD for a few bites is truly legit and memorable. You're better off ordering an entire cake for about $55 CAD from them and getting much more. Needless to say, I wouldn't leave Miku without trying it. Tip is to order this early on in your meal. They supposedly make around 60 slices a day. Once it's out, it is no more for that day. So reserve your slice early on! It's pretty amaze-balls. Although, the menu is quite minimal, you can still get caught up trying to figure out how you want to mix and match the items. Do you want to do an independent thing where what you order, is what you consume? Or do you want to share whatever is thrown onto the table? During dinner, they do have some individual set menu options like the Shokai ($68 CAD), Kaisen ($88 CAD), and Aburi ($135 CAD). We got a little boggled up with the menu so Lenny came to the rescue. He first asked us which items we were interested in and then he ended up suggesting a better and efficient approach. We were grateful for his insight. We ended up with our own Miku Signature Selection each, $36 CAD. This is a nice variety of various sushi and aburi; a total of 10 pieces. I don't think there was anything we didn't like. The server (I didn't get her name), carefully explained each item on the plate when it came out. She also took the time to suggest which order of consumption would maximize the full flavors and enjoyment. Again, we took her advice and found it to be quite pleasant. We kept the aburi oshi salmon for last. Let's just say, I was tempted to get another order of it on its own a la carté.You can really pass up on the tuna and kaiso seaweed tartare appetizer, $18 CAD. It was strangely crafted together like a piece of artwork and it did lack on some flavor and quantity. There's really not much to say about it.Miku is a snazzy, date-like, I have money to throw away type spot. The food is good but far from plentiful while the price is inflated. The service throughout the night was superb. We did make reservations and they would not sit us until the exact time even though we were there a little early. With Vancouver's endless amount of sick sushi options for affordable prices and greater quantity, I'm not sure if I'm sold on a near future Miku return. It's definitely a great spot for the tourists and the 1%. We did walk out full in the end but only because each plate came out slowly and we took our time enjoying the meal rather than stuffing our faces full in a short span of time. It was a chilled, slow-paced date night with a lovely view for us. The prices reflect the key location of the restaurant.",7/29/2017,3 star rating
264,Kirk K.,"Colorado Springs, United States","Spectacular service, presentation and dining room, from start to finish to match up with other reviews. On a Friday night at 7:30pm I was able to get 1-seat at the bar with only a 5 minute wait. Couples walking in at the same time got tables within 20 minutes. As a big fan of freshwater eel, I ordered 2 pieces of the bbq eel Aburi style (a way that it's prepared). The eel itself was very tender, fresh and easy to chew. However, I felt that both pieces had too much bbq sauce on them. I would be hesitant to order again. The salmon oshi roll was simple yet delicious. How the BC caught salmon is done Aburi style (lightly flame seared) is nothing I've had before. While holding a very sweet flavor paired with the Miku sauce, the jalapeño slice on top of each roll gave it a bomb contrast When each plate was delivered, the employee explained what everything was without missing a beat. Even on a plate to the couple next to me that had a 10 piece Nigiri plate. It's obvious the staff is trained well on each dish on the menu.",8/17/2019,5 star rating

268,Louise B.,"Portland, United States","Excitement for fresh seafood at this highly rated sushi restaurant on the waterfront waned with the first wave of aburi sushi that arrived, their signature 'flame-seared' series; we tried the salmon oshi $17. It was overtly sweet and candy like and not to our liking at all.Coal Harbor Seafood Platter $33 was flavorless boiled or poached? seafood with 3 dipping sauces chimchurri, vinaigrette and chili that translated amateurism, ditto for the 2 of 3 sauces, thick and unrefined. The 3 bites of poke and octopus that we had hoped were the stars also never lit up.Miku Signature Sushi selection $36 did nothing to get dinner back on track either.  More sweet aburi and hubby ate most else refusing the aburi which he kindly placed on my plate. He was so underwhelmed we wondered how we could have ordered so wrong and struck out on 3 at bats with the large dishes ordered. I left hungry with $86 into the meal not including desserts and went to Peaceful Rest for some Sichuan Beef Noodles to salvage the night and cure the hunger.Cocktails, old fashioned and blood and sand were fine but would love to have seen more showcase of Japanese whiskey in the cocktail mix.Desserts, white chocolate lime leaf mousse $14, lychee sorbet $4.50,  and Tropical Brunoise $13.50 were just okay and beauty of the plate can't mask the lack of depth in flavor and that is the defining message of Miku, Flamed Out.Ambience is lively and visuals are stunning,  including food presentation, but with nothing else to back up the profile, I would neither recommend or return, its just too expensive to compete for better results.  The waiter also could not hear our order/questions bc its very loud, and the locked in booths seating 6 meant we were constantly shuffling to allow the insider, middle, out to use restroom.  Very awkward for business dinner.",9/25/2017,2 star rating
269,Chuck N.,"San Francisco, United States","Quite possibly the most unique sushi you'll ever taste, and that's because they do their own original ""Aburi"" style which is, to best describe imperfectly, searing sushi into a pressed style with mayo (I think) underneath the fish, a layer of thin fish between, atop sushi rice. Think a seared roll combined with nigiri, with a sweet touch of Japanese mayo. I think that is the way to describe it. Doesn't matter, get it.In fact, we got the $45 CAD summer prefix menu which was worth every penny ($38 USD) for 4 unique sides that were all amazing (lobster tail - yum, cold soba with duck breast - wow, tuna tartar - only meh, and fried fish - meh). 2 of those 4 were great. The sushi, other than the aburi was average, nothing special, but the aburi is 5 star easy. The green tea or chocolate desserts are also excellent, and service is great. They were very attentive to allergy needs.Definitely a must visit in Vancouver for the aburi sushi alone.",6/5/2018,5 star rating

Half of the items we got are actually recommended by Zomato reviewers & they are absolutely correct. The sashimi itself tastes like the sea & the freshness comes out in every bite! Aburi Prime is a variety & I think it would be appreciated by food enthusiasts hence I don't fully recommend it to all; but the highlights for us - and we ordered it again 'cause it's good- are the Ebi Fritters & the Salmon Oshi Sushi!Every bite of these luxuries artscraft leaves an oversatisfactory palette even after leaving Miku.

Tasty for seaweed is the best I can describe it!* sashimi - albacore melted disintegrated in your mouth upon impact. Also, got maguro and thought they mistakenly brought me tuna belly instead. I asked my server to clarify and she said no that's our red tuna. Wow! See my pics and notice the lush marbling.* signature roll - melted salmon on top of sticky rice  stuffed with ground salmon. One word.... BUTTER!Tip: The food is so rich I'd recommend ordering half of what you normally would. If you're still hungry then order more later. It's the equivalent to eating a 6oz. prime bone-in filet vs. a 10oz. choice.Noteworthy: Entire back of restaurant is glass windows offering tranquil views of the water and city lights at night.

It usually comes with 5, but we were able to order 1 more piece, which we were so happy we did or else we wouldve fought for the last piece!The Salmon Oshi Oshi was delicious! Probably my favorite of the sushi that we ordered. The nigiri was fresh and delicious.Our waitress was very attentive and kind! She was patient with us and gave us her recommendations which were great choices. Atmosphere was nice, but very busy, which is understandable now.We were full off all the food we ordered. but definitely pleased! Miku was probably my favorite restaurant during our visit to Vancouver.",1/10/2019,5 star rating
283,Sasha K.,"Greater Vancouver Regional District, BC","This place has the view that's worth more than a million bucks and they have the menu that has the Aburi Oshi Sushi which is quite possibly the best sushi you'll ever try.  However, Minami in Yaletown is their sister restaurant and I can definitely say that they outrank Miku in every sense.  Service here (especially from the hostesses) isn't very welcoming.  Their menu also lacks many of the fabulous items that Minami offers.  The orders take forever even though Minami is far busier; so I don't really take being packed as an excuse when their counterpart exceeds in service.  The first Salmon Aburi Oshi Sushi was identical to the several that I've had previously at Minami however the second order's sauce was a bit on the salty side.  If you're planning on having a date night with a view, this definitely is a nice location however if quality of service and food matters to you then I would highly suggest hopping over to Yaletown and checking out Minami.",4/25/2018,3 star rating
284,Ken C.,"Toronto, ON","Went there while on a business trip, had a seat at the bar, which was nice because I was able to watch the chefs at work making the various kinds of sushi. Great view of Canada Place and the water from the bar and many tables near the bar.Service was attentive, even for us singles at the bar, as several servers came by to make sure my needs were met. Food was very good -- I ordered the Ebi Fritters, the Miku Signature Collection (variety of sushi of different styles) and the Tropical Brunoise for dessert. Ebi Fritters were great (very big shrimp) and the sushi plate offered a chance to try all different styles, which is good for first-timers at Miku. The dessert was not worth it in my opinion, it wasn't as sweet as I'd like and had a bit too much of a fruity/tarty taste.Sushi was by far the highlight of the meal. My fave was the Aburi Oshi sushi, which comes as rectangular bricks of sushi rice topped with a layer of mushed up and pressed fish or shrimp, mixed in with some kind of sauce and lightly seared by hand torch before serving. OK that maybe didn't sound as good as it tasted, but believe me, it tasted great. Also got one or two Miku rolls which were also great. Only complaints about this platter are (a) after trying the specialty sushi, the more pedestrian nigiri sushi was blah in comparison (but still way better than the crap you typically get in Toronto) and (b) there could have been maybe 3 more pieces to satisfy me (and also to justify the $36 price tag).While there are a lot of great sushi places in Vancouver, this one stands out because of the location and view. Note however, that they try hard to create a trendy vibe with their dressed-in-black waitstaff and modern décor, but that contrasts with the shorts and sandals on half the patrons given that it's a fairly touristy area. The concierge at my hotel told me I should dress up to go there but that's absolutely unnecessary.",8/7/2017,4 star rating

286,Hong T.,"Phoenix, United States",Now I won't deny I was a pain in the butt at this place. I didn't want seaweed and they were willing up acomadate by giving me more Vegan nigiri on my lunch special. To alter a lunch special at a more traditional Japanese restaurant AND a fancy one no less is unheard of and terrible etiquette on my part. But they did it and I loved my food! It was truly an art the way they crafted this food. Even the Vegan sushi was stellar and that's leaving out any fish. Thanks again for breaking those barriers and giving me the opportunity to try this food with my non vegan counterpart. Fantastic flavors and I really loved the tofu.,4/23/2019,5 star rating
287,Matthew T.,"Honolulu, United States","We had a very good experience here and recommend Miku. My wife and I both had the Aburi Prime tasting menu - ""aburi"" meaning partially grilled or torched on the topside in Japanese. We've had many an aburi nigiri in Honolulu, Tokyo, SF and NYC, and found Miku to be inventive and the fish the be delicious. One thing that was off putting about the sushi was the rice, which was all wrong - cold, hard, and under seasoned. Top sushi restaurants put as much care into their rice and they do their fish, with itamae in the best sushiya training for years solely on rice. Miku needs more help in this area. Otherwise, service was professional and efficient, and the cost was relatively reasonable. We appreciated the inventiveness of the sushi and hope the rice will be better should we come back to Miku.",12/29/2018,4 star rating
288,Tom P.,"San Francisco, United States","We came here on our last night in Vancouver. We wanted to order chirashi tart but was told that it was lunch item only. We also wanted Kobe beef nigiri and uni nigiri but they ran out of both. In order to make us feel better, the waitress presented to us each a ceviche amuse-bouche. The service was attentive and fast. Aburi lobster tail: 5 out of 5 stars. The side salad was whatever and the lobster tail was tiny. However, it was definitely one of the best lobsters I have ever tried. The lobster was fresh and the tomato-based sauce was the kicker. It brought out the best of the lobster. This dish is definitely up there with the Michelin starred restaurant lobster that I've tried in SF. Salmon Oshi Sushi: 5 out of 5 stars. One word to describe this dish: amazeballs...or two if you hyphenate it. But anyway I'll describe it more now. The seared salmon was rich and buttery. The jalapeño added a kick. In the future I could come here and just order this dish alone. This item is the must-get.Saba Oshi Sushi: doesn't look very appetizing and sure enough is not, no need to be adventurous and explore this one, just stick with the Salmon Oshi Sushi.Miku Roll: if you want a roll get this one, it's good but not the reason to come hereRed Wave Roll: average tasting, nothing specialPS: thanks to the other Yelper who reminded me to grab the mint chocolate on the way out",7/4/2017,5 star rating
289,April P.,"Seattle, United States","I came here at lunch time and initially ordered the Miku Zen and Chef's Select to share between my partner and I. Unfortunately, I had to change my order because of my shellfish allergy and the fact that the fish they use for these dishes come in contact with shellfish. I ordered some nigiri and the cured mackerel aburi sushi. The Chef's Select looked lovely and I was disappointed that I was not able to order that, my nigiri was okay. Very traditional and the fish quality was great and fresh. I was just hoping for the same type of nigiri that came in the Chef's Select that has toppings. The cured mackerel aburi sushi with the miso on top was tasty! Overall, the restaurant is lovely and the food was good. I appreciate the restaurant being so careful with my shellfish allergy.",5/18/2019,4 star rating
290,Stephanie C.,"Vancouver, BC","Every evening this place is packed!  Always make a reservation.  Great atmosphere here and an amazing view of beautiful Coal Harbour and the Mountains.  The seafood is fresh and delicious, and the presentation is incredible.  Known for their Aburi Sushi, a flame seared technique, the Salmon Oshi is a must try!  My other favourites are the Pan Seared Scallops, and the Kyoto Saikyo Miso Baked Sablefish.  This is an stand out seafood restaurant in the heart of downtown Vancouver, with phenomenal views.  The servers are super attentive and helpful.  Being a fancy pants seafood restaurant be prepared to pay fancy prices.  Great for a special occasion or celebration.",4/30/2018,5 star rating
291,Tony J.,"Jersey City, United States","We got the Miku Zen, a set course lunch very reasonably priced at CA$32. You get a sampler of four entrees and five pieces of sushi, as well as miso soup.The beef shank was mouthwateringly tender and came in a rich sauce with mashed potatoes. The chicken breast was tasty and moist. The colossal prawn was juicy and fresh. The salad was just a typical Japanese restaurant salad, lightly dressed.The sushi was very unique, in their signature aburi oshi style. Basically they put a savory sauce on it and then it is lightly seared. Obviously not the most traditional way of making sushi but props to them for originality. Ultimately the final product was full of umami and all the flavors came together in your mouth harmoniously.",7/21/2018,4 star rating
292,Frankie R.,"Los Angeles, United States","In one word: underwhelming.The setting: Firstly, the restaurant itself is beautiful. Very high end fine dining restaurant, and the views are spectacular if you're lucky enough to get the right table. Unfortunately for my husband and I, we were seated in a very average spot that felt a little cramped and only one of us had kind of a decent view. The service: fantastic. Our server was lovely, very sweet and professional. I wish I'd gotten her name, because she deserves a mention for sure. The guy who delivered our food was very knowledgeable and professional as well. The food: presentation was great, but the quality of the fish and even the sushi rice seemed below average, dry and hard. We forked out for the Miku five course set menu and the only part of it I really enjoyed was the filet mignon course, which, for a sushi restaurant, wasn't really what we were excited for.  Overall, we spent $400 on an underwhelming meal that left us disappointed. I wish we'd just ordered a couple of the rolls and left it at that. My advice: for the same money, buy yourself a ticket to Los Angeles and head to Sugar Fish. For fifty bucks, you can get yourself the full course chef's menu and the food there is second to none. I doubt we'll bother visiting a Miku again.",10/8/2019,3 star rating
293,Kendall O.,"Durham, United States","This was the best place we ate in Vancouver. I made a reservation and asked for a table by the water, and got it! We started with the scallop trio - amazing. We also ordered the salmon and ebi oshi sushi based on the recommendation of our server. Weren't sure if we were going to like the slightly seared style, but we absolutely loved it! We weren't sure how much food to order, but based on the recommendation of our server, we also ordered the Red Wave roll, which was also delicious. I'm not usually much of a dessert person, but we shared the Green Tea Opera dessert, and have been wanting another ever since. Wish we had dined here more than once during our visit. Highly recommend for both the service and the food! Worth noting that we also went to Blue Water Cafe, which was also good, but Miku was better (and less expensive!).",5/9/2017,5 star rating
294,Isabella L.,"Ottawa, ON","Miku is the restaurant I reserve for all my special occasions whether it be a friend flying in, anniversary, birthday, you name it...The food here is incredible, especially their oshi sushi! Not only that but the service here is noteworthy. They always serve with a smile and are very knowledgable of their menu. Two standout experiences was when eating the spotted prawn sashimi, we were offered to have the heads deep fried as a complimentary dish (shared out of whim by our server at the time). Another moment was during my anniversary, and since we come here quite often, I asked if a certain dish could be switched in a set course. The server happily asked and to our surprise we got a custom dessert with a lovely 'Happy Anniversary' message, which was very sweet as we only told them that in the comment section of our reservation!Every occasion where I have the chance to come here, I will. Miku is my go-to place for an amazing culinary experience. Recommend: Salmon Oshi Sushi, Miku Waterfront Platter, Miku signature selection.",2/5/2019,5 star rating

296,Dongwoo S.,"South of Market, San Francisco, United States","No idea how this place is 4.5 stars with 1600+ reviews. I was kind of expecting this place to have  nigiris that melts in your mouth with top notch fresh ingredient similar to some places in Seattle that has 4.5 stars with hundreds of reviews like shiros, or kappo tamura. But unfortunately it was not even close.I was greeted with kind and warmness. The ambience of the place was of a 5 star hotel restaurant run by rich chinese. I tried the lunch shokai at miku to try little bit of everything. Surprisingly the menu came out very fast, in fact, too fast. It gave me an impression that these were all made ahead of time. I think that this was indeed true because the aburi, nigiri, and rolls were cold.Aburi was unique. I give credit for that. But it did not surprise me in a good way. The ingredient used was mediocre and miku tried to cover it up by using tons of dressing and sauces. A big red flag. This applies the same to nigiris, rolls and even the appetizer and entree. This is sad to say but the best thing I had was their green tea..I am not still sure how this place is rated at 4.5. One thing I am sure is that I wont be coming here when I am craving good sushis.",8/20/2019,2 star rating

This visit, I started with a seaweed salad followed by a miso soup and premium plate. Oh and a Moscow Mule of course. The cocktail was delicious and the food was the perfect accompaniment. The seaweed salad was a bowl of texture and healthy deliciousness. The miso was salty, piping hot and the best I've ever had. I wish they'd make bowls as big as a pho or ramen for miso! The premium plate was Devine. If you don't like this sushi you loco! Every bite you wanna scream then cry with joy! I take my time but it's hard to when the fish is this fresh and incredibly plated.

302,Samantha N.,"Markham, ON","Solid 4.5 starsLikes:- Green tea opera cake - this is a must try dessert! - Definitely try their signature offerings, including the aburi sushi. You can't go wrong with ordering seafood here.Not as impressive:- I would stick with their seafood offerings / sushi and not so much other kinds of protein. Don't get me wrong, the fillet mignon I tried was good, but the fish and aburi sushi was much better than just good.I have always been curious to know how Miku in Toronto compared to the one in Vancouver, so this was definitely on the top of my list! I opted for the Kaisen Kaiseki ($98), a 5-course tasting menu that gave a good flavour of the restaurant's signature offerings. The only problem was, there was no sight of the green tea opera cake on the menu. However, upon request, Miku gladly swapped out the berry pavlova with their signature dessert at no additional charge.Amuse Bouche - I couldn't make out all the ingredients in this bite sized goodie, but there was wild sockeye salmon tartar, topped with pear jelly and a refreshing citrus-y dressing. It was nicely balanced, but nothing exceptional.First Course - Of the daily selection of sashimi offered (sweet shrimp, tuna, hamachi and wild sockeye salmon), my favourite was definitely the hamachi. It was not oily and had a slight springy texture, with bold flavours in every bite. I was not a big fan of the wild sockeye salmon sashimi though. It may have been a combination of the cut being too lean plus wild fish may generally have a less fat as they are able to freely roam in the oceans. It lacked the buttery and fatty texture found in most farmed salmon.Second Course -  The seafood trio was cleverly presented using minimalistic stacked serving bowls. The oyster was ocean fresh. The miso-baked sablefish was to die for. It just melted in my mouth with the yuzu-miso reduction nicely balancing out the buttery bite. The pan-seared scallop was cooked to perfection, although there wasn't anything special about the flavour profile. Third Course - The sous-vide filet mignon was tender and juicy, but as I mentioned above, I would stick with ordering seafood!Fourth Course - The aburi sushi, lightly torched on the top, with a piece of charcoal in between, not only had a wonderful charred smoky flavor, the fatty flavours were also accentuated with the fish oils dripping into the rice. The entire plate of sushi was pillowy soft and the different sauces added was a nice compliment. Fifth Course - The green tea opera cake was quite the sweet ending. The various layers of chocolate, green tea and hazelnut cream was luscious and rich, with the hazelnuts adding a nice crunch. Apparently, this cake takes a good 3 days to make.Overall, I enjoyed the experience and found the meal to be pretty good value for the variety you get. I knocked off 0.5 stars as I still prefer good old fashioned sushi. An added bonus was that instead of paying the usual 13% tax in Toronto, only a 5% tax is added to meals in Vancouver!",3/11/2018,4 star rating

I came here for my birthday and not only did they provide excellent service, they went above and beyond to make me feel special. Our server was fantastic.The food is in a category of its own. We tried various sushi and nigiri, torched nigiri, oshi aburi, and the prime rib. I cannot pick a favourite, they were each so perfect. The flavours were so balanced and the food melts in your mouth, it is so cooked to perfection.

They have blankets on the chairs outside.For groups of 8 or more try and book the private room. It's worth it. You'll have an amazing view of the water.I'm not a fan of seafood because it makes me nauseous but this made me feel good afterwords and was clean.

306,Sherry C.,"San Jose, United States","Came here because it has great reviews and being in Vancouver, I figure I probably couldn't go wrong with seafood. Miku is known for their signature Aburi-style cuisine with food served on beautiful Arita plate ware from Kyushu, Japan. For dinner, I ordered the Miku roll but was bummed as it was lacking uni (sea urchin) being out of season. However, I still got it because it looked good. I also had a miso soup, the Aburi lobster tail and a botan ebi (sweet shrimp) and an ikura (salmon roe) nigiri.The Aburi Lobster tail came with scallop-ikura couscous, roasted vegetables and cayenne tomato aioli miso herb sauce. the Miku roll has salmon, crab, cucumber rolled in tobiko and Miku sauce, even lacking an ingredient I really like, was still decadently delicious.

307,Nicki P.,"Middletown, United States","This is a nice upscale sushi restaurant with great views of the coast. If you want to eat here, you must make reservations in advance. We made reservations 2 nights in advance, and only had a choice between 5pm and 9pm on a Monday night. For drinks I tried the house sake, which I liked. For apps we tried the ebi fritters- basically fried shrimp with a sweet chili aioli sauce. The shrimp were fried to perfection- nice and crispy, yet flavorful and juicy, and the sauce was a nice compliment to the shrimp. For the main course, I had the salmon aburi, ebi aburi, red tuna sushi, and wagyu beef aburi sushi. Aburi style is not something I have had before- but basically the top part of the fish is slightly cooked. Since I am not familiar with this style, I thought it was ok. I enjoy raw salmon over aburi style any day. I also noticed that although sushi is mostly about the rice, the slice of fish itself on each piece was very small. I enjoy a nice mix of fish and rice in my sushi, but I felt each bite was mostly rice. The ebi aburi also had a tart sauce on top which i did not particularly like. Over all, the fish itself was fresh. Would I come back? Probably not. But if you like aburi style- you may like this restaurant. It is packed everyday for a reason. I am still glad that I had the opportunity to try it.",4/25/2018,4 star rating
308,Sara J.,"Durham, United States","I was recommended this spot as the best sushi place in town, and while it was definitely a good meal with great, friendly service, it had some hits and misses.We all got the aburi prime kaiseki, and while I thought the aburi sushi entree was lovely, we didn't all love the other items on the kaiseki menu, such as the chawanmushi and dessert. And a random note-I was sad they didn't fry up the head of my shrimp sushi appetizer as I feel is almost de rigeur for fresh shrimp. Cocktails and drink pairing were excellent, and they were kind enough to make some nice non-alcoholic options for our friend who doesn't drink alcohol. Service was super friendly and excellent. Atmosphere is buzzy. Location right next to the convention center is convenient as well. Overall, I'm happy I went and really did enjoy my aburi platter-but might skip on the entire kaiseki and order a la carte to fill in my meal next time.",4/24/2018,4 star rating

310,Daniel B.,"Kirkland, United States","The vision for Miku is impeccable. A Japanese fusion of culinary art, freshness, and innovation makes this one of the best restaurants in Vancouver.Modernly furnished in a great location right next to Canada Place and tourist attractions alike, Miku can get crazy busy and crowded, but is worth the wait. The outside seating is clean and has a great view of the vast ocean and the many boats coming to the harbor. The interior design is family friendly, yet elegant to accommodate a fine dining experience. Service was smooth as they have an abundant staff working to make the dining experience transition from the moment you sit down and leave satisfied.The menu was quite small, but actually secretly large. Many of the sushi plates are chef prepared seasonally depending on the fresh fish they have that day. Thus, you won't exactly know what you're getting, but a culinary surprise enhances people's desire to experience something new. I opted to have a hanger steak entree instead of sushi, which was more of a western dish, but was still fantastic. The steak was like a slow braised brisket; melts in your mouth and pulls off just by using chopsticks. It was accompanied with a sake soy glaze, parsnip puree, maitake mushrooms, and an assortment of veggies in a cast iron skillet. The dish was balanced and well executed and I loved every bite. You definitely can't leave here without having dessert after having such a great meal. I went with the green tea opera. The dessert was a chocolate ganache layered with sweet matcha genoise, azuki bean, and comes with matcha ice cream. Plated elegantly with a mango puree, fresh berries, and an aesthetically placed sugar glass makes this a green tea explosion that's not overly sweet and finishes the meal.Miku is worth every experience for any occasion. Not a traditional Japanese restaurant, the success of the fusion experience will entice anyone who goes there and I'd go back there if I ever get to go to downtown Vancouver.",5/28/2018,5 star rating
311,Bobby F.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, ON","This is one of the classiest sushi restaurants I've been to.

The prices are a bit on the expensive side, but the quality of food is excellent and I would definitely like to return.Here's what we ordered:Ebi Fritters ($14) - White tiger prawns, herb-beer batter, sweet chilli aioli, soy-balsamic reduction, chill powder (these were SO good, I'm not normally a fan of prawns but these were plump and juicy and the flavours were very well done) Salmon Oshi Sushi ($17) - Pressed BC wild sockeye salmon, jalapeno, Miku sauce (one of my favourites of the night! We actually got a second order of this afterwards) Ebi Oshi Sushi ($16.50) - Pressed prawn, lime zest, ume sauce (was very pleasantly surprised by this, the flavours complimented one another very well and will order this again next time)Saba Oshi Sushi ($16) - Pressed house mackerel, miso sauce (this one was a miss for both of us, it was really too fishy and the saltiness of the miso didn't help for me)Red Wave Roll ($17.50) - Crab, avocado, wrapped in red tuna, masatake sauce (very strong flavours as well, but I'm too hypnotized by the aburi)Green Tea Opera ($14) - Green tea genoise, matcha butter cream, dark chocolate ganache, azuki bean cream, hazelnut water, matcha ice cream (plating was excellent! This tasted more chocolatey than matcha in my opinion, but was still nice) Verdict: Service - 3.5/5 Food - 5/5Would I return: Yes!!",2/11/2017,5 star rating
314,Lyndzee M.,"Bossier City, United States","I was disappointed in this place, what I thought was going to be the best most amazing sushi restaurant I've ever experienced turned out to be an out of the box sushi experience. Do not misread this review, the place is incredible for opening the palate and making you go outside the box in your food choices but I felt like I paid way too much for this flare of Fusion cuisine. They sear the sushi instead of rolling it and they get really offended if you ask for soy sauce (they still will bring it to you).

There are no words that will properly describe the perfection of Miku's Green Tea Opera Cake: green tea génoise, matcha butter cream, dark chocolate ganache, azuki bean cream, hazelnut wafer, matcha ice cream, fruit. So now back to the other food... Also delicious. They are famous for they Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi - local salmon pressed with soy, Miku sauce, thin slices of jalapéno, cracked pepper. It was good, I just think the rice to everything else ratio was overwhelming and so I will pass on this next time. Miku Roll (my fav of the sushi here), albacore, beni-sake, unagi were all spectacular.Excellent service, incredible artistry, delicious ingredients. Highly recommend!",6/9/2018,5 star rating

322,Lan N.,"San Jose, United States","This is a great place to grab some sushi. Although they offer a coursed menu (kaiseki) that looked pretty nice, we decided to just order some sushi. You have to try their aburi oshi style sushi. They offer salmon, shrimp and mackerel. We got the salmon and shrimp varieties. Aburi oshi style is pressed sushi and lightly seared protein on top. It creates a different melt in your mouth texture and a slight smokiness. Their rice is also really good. Probably some of the best sushi rice I've had outside of Japan. If you seen documentaries about sushi, you know that rice is the key to good sushi and these don't disappoint. Their miku roll and nigiri options didn't disappoint either.Our 1 year old was also with us and they did offer a kids' udon bowl for her. I think that might be the only ""kid"" option. If you bring your kid be ready to ask for some custom options or eat from their regular menu.Although there were a few kids here it is more catered to have dinner with friends or even take a client. The trendy atmosphere and great view of the harbor makes for a nice environment.",12/5/2016,4 star rating
323,Allen J.,"Issaquah, United States","Delicious. Make reservations early. We were only able to snag a 9:15pm reservation, which meant that the options on the menu were cut in half. They ran out of two things that we ordered and the waitress had to come back twice to break the bad news. With that said, it was still amazing. The service was great, and the food we did have was delicious. The salmon really does just melt in your mouth. The environment is very modern. Expect it to be loud. Overall still had a great experience. Would go again.",7/1/2018,5 star rating
324,Grace Y.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, United States","In celebration of something very special, Miku will always be a fond place. We made a special request to be seated by the windows facing the ocean, which is always a nice touch during a dinner. Our waitress was kind enough to provide us with Miku's  specials. We ordered the:1. Beef Carpaccio: Thinly sliced pieces of raw prime beef, topped with a raw egg, garnished with alfalfa sprouts and small flower petals. 2. Sunset Roll: This was delicious!3. Tuna Belly Sashimi: Buttery goodness4. Salmon Oshi Sushi (Aburi) - Aburi is a Miku specialty where their ""rolls"" are rectangular, topped with salmon that is torched/seared. This is a must try. Remember to make a reservation before coming here. We had reservations, so coming here was a breeze. However, we did speak with others without reservations who had to wait a long time.*Parking: Parked in the convention lot down the street, this was expensive.

325,Yingna L.,"San Francisco, United States","Absolutely amazing dining experience - breathtaking view of the harbor, aesthetically pleasing and gorgeous tasting premium omakase, and professional and friendly service. What else can you ask for! The omakase premium nigiri pieces were aesthetically constructed, well balanced - every bite into it yields a slightly different yet coherent balance of flavors. However, unlike my prior experience of omakase at more traditional Japanese restaurants where the nigiris were made right in front of you and the rice was still warm and becomes and integral part of each piece, the nigiri pieces were premade and rice was cold - not as traditional, but the aesthetics of it certainly makes up for it in my opinion. The ebi fritters were rich, crunchy, well flavored. The oshi sushi were certainly unique, beautifully pressed, clean and neat, yet so richly and layered with flavors and smoothness in your mouth! Would like to come back and get more of those oshi!",5/4/2019,5 star rating
326,Malinee S.,"Lake Stevens, United States",Very nice beautiful Setting. I didn't have a reservation so I was waiting for an hour for a table. Salmon oshi sushi 5stars.

The best dish was the matcha opera cake. It was one of the best cake I have had in my life.,6/8/2018,4 star rating
327,Serena L.,"Bellevue, United States","Miku takes Aburi sushi to the next level . Every piece of their sushi is like an art. Aburi is fish that has been flame-seared, much like a creme brulee is seared to caramelize the sugars. This brings a slightly smoky, somewhat nutty flavor to the fatty fish. The salmon oshi literally melts in your mouth. It gets better with each bite!",5/20/2019,4 star rating

330,Shannon L.,"East Bay, United States","Come here for the aburi oshi sushi! It's unique to a lot of Japanese restaurants in Vancouver. I liked the ebi (shrimp) version and the salmon version. I was also a fan of the other nigiri which are made in a similar fashion, with a special sauce on top (and not necessarily with flame seared). With regular nigiri, I feel like the quality of the fish is solid but nothing I can't get in SF. It's all imported from the same place (Japan), right? I wasn't a fan of our appetizer, the tempura fish and chips. Both the fish and tartar sauce were bland. The ponzu and lotus root chips were good though. I'd skip this.Last but not least, the opera cake. It's a green tea and red bean lover's delight. The cake has layers of each along with a layer of crunchy stuff for texture. The scoop of green tea ice cream had a weak tea flavor though and it was difficult to eat it on a plate. The hostesses weren't really managing the queue well and were about to seat another party of the same size before us even though they came after us. I mentioned that and they seemed confused. Other than that, no hiccups. Be sure to take the chocolates on the way out; they're good.",11/12/2016,3 star rating

332,Mei W.,"Sacramento, United States","I hate it when I have such high expectations for a restaurant but end up leaving disappointed.And unfortunately Miku so happens to be one of them. Let me start off with the positives. The ambiance of this restaurant is contemporary and the location sits on the harbor with a spectacular view. They have outdoor seating available but my sister and I opted to sit indoors and the views were just as great. Service was impeccable from beginning to end. The food was underwhelming. We ordered the coal harbour to start off with as appetizer. It comes with oysters, clams and mussels that were not meaty at all. The oysters and mussels in particular were super tiny. For our entrees we ordered several nigiri sushi along with a pressed salmon sushi dish shaped in squares. (I can't remember the name.) The fish was extra super dry and was slightly chewy. I was really expecting a moist, tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture...but sadly I was let down. I'm a big sashimi eater and my palate is well acquainted with how fresh fish tastes! I did not like how the press salmon sushi was prepared. It was slightly torched with a mayo sauce on top that did not compliment well with the sushi. It was also hard to eat since everything fell apart when I picked it up with my chopsticks. I believe all restaurants deserve a second chance and I'm hoping my experience so happened to be an off-night. I'll probably give it another try, that is if I'm ever in the area again.",8/8/2016,2 star rating
333,Sam M.,"Pasadena, United States",This was a truly exceptional dining experience: from service to food to view. We got the omakase and of course two kinds of aburi oshi sushi.

That is great if you friend does not want to share the roll with you or if you are alone and want to try more types of rolls.I had the salmon Oshi Sushi and Miku Roll. They were both delicious, mainly due to the sauce. I think they put crack on it, I just want to keep eating them and lick up all the sauce. Of the two, I much prefer Miku Roll. It was just so good, but it was also so rich that it could get a bit jelak* after a while. Miku specializes in Aburi sushi and chirashi is only available for lunch.

Desert was over the topDecor +5Selection. +5. Emotional Maturity +5. Bathrooms +5. Real doors on the stalls!Temperature. +5. Just right.Employees +3.75. The sushi is artful and tasty. The Shoyu is not overly salty so it is very good quality- usually I bring my own (Emperor's agricultural award quality). I highly recommend eating the sushi without soy sauce and then take a bit after each piece, you may enjoy the flavor more. Do try the carbon blasted sushi, it melts in your mouth. The vegan sushi is exceptional and looks beautiful. Skip the mini opera desert and go for the big one, then you will feel like you didn't miss out. So many flavors in this desert! This place is right on the waterfront and exceptionally clean and the bathrooms are perfect. This is a very well run restaurant. Our male French Canadian server was very kind and helpful and not at all the suck up useless type who tries to seduce your date in search of extra money. I wish the rest of the staff were more present. Perhaps that is the focus: on clients who are gutter boys and girls, who act cool, yet remind me of yesterdays trash. The tea is very good and sucks at the same time, because it is overly hot in insulated teapots. Much better to have a ceramic teapot and use a laser thermometer to calibrate the temperature. Adding cool water reduces the boiling temperature before you add the tea leaves. Feeling burned by the tea is a loss. I feel this place is run by non-Japanese because it has no feeling, only form. The sushi looks perfect, yet the place has no soul. The reception and wait staff that are women have short skirts and act trendy, basically vapid women, who may please someone. The place is too noisy with harsh sound caused by blank walls and lots of glass. If they put hanging fabric in grids on the ceiling, this would reduce the echo and make it more personable. The tech side works flawlessly, our online order was taken at their website, we are in the USA, then we received the ability to confirm, and received an email the day of. Of course we went on a cruise and were not going to miss this, especially when we were pushed off the boat at such an early hour (not really). The plates were very pretty and I really appreciated that. Overall, I will come back. Fairly high price, yet the quality is there to make it worthwhile.",10/18/2019,5 star rating

337,Liz L.,"Seattle, United States","Disclaimer: I want to give this place 4.5 stars. Came here for dinner after we checked into our hotel because we were both starving before 6 (yup, early bird special :p). We weren't sure where to go, but this place was basically right next door (to the Pan Pacific) and since it was freezing, we decided to stop in. It wasn't super busy when we got there, but not having reservations and wanting to sit at a table, we got stuck at a small table under the tv on a small wall between windows.First things first, we ordered drinks- I got the Miyazaki #2 (Havana club seven year rum, ginger liqueur, mango purée, basil citrus foam) and I was very happy with mine. H got the Shiso Mojito (tantakatan Japanese schochu, fresh shiso, like, sparkling water) and felt his was a little watered down.  Told the waiter/server/bartender and he made him a brand new drink with a little more booze and then H was happy. We got the Aburi Oshi Sushi (""pressed sushi"" layered rectangle sushi) with BC wild sockeye salmon, Miku sauce, jalapeño and one with ebi (shrimp), lime zest, and ume sauce. They were both delicious. And I actually really enjoyed the lime with the ebi. We also got some salmon sashimi and the Red Wave Roll (crab, avocado, wrapped in tuna with masatake sauce). Sashimi was great. The roll was decent. For dessert, we opted for the Green Tea Opera: green tea genoise, matcha buttercream, dark chocolate ganache, azuki bean cream, hazelnut wafer, and matcha ice cream. Yum. Definitely worth getting to end the meal. Lovely atmosphere, great staff (super friendly, attentive), great food, great drinks, will come back for sure the next time I'm in Vancouver.

I had the fried calamari and flame seared salmon sushi. Everything was very fresh. The salmon sushi had a small slice of green pepper in the middle of the surface but it was not spicy at all. The rice was glazed with soy sauce so there's no need to further dip it. I savoured every bit while looking out at the lovely view of the sky and water over the big window.

The bartender told us the toro was $8 when it was $9 and didn't even say he was mistaken even after we got the check. We got the salmon and ebi aburi sushi. It was good (probably 3.5/5).. but obviously the food did not make up for the incompetent hostesses... and had a little too much mayo. The salmon one was pretty well balanced though so I would recommend that only. It was $17 for each of the aburi sushi which is not a bad deal for 6 pieces. It was definitely unique with a boxy shape and smoky taste. Next time just have your hostess say ""I'll be with you in a minute"" while she's looking at the reservations and quote an accurate time instead of adding an extra 30 minute wait while your reservations are not showing up.. I just felt pretty affronted by how rude the hostesses were (the two at the reservation screen on Friday). Only the asian hostess who took us to the table actually acknowledged us and said whatever her name is will be with us in a minute. Would not recommend during peak time.

366,Heather L.,"Toronto, ON","This place was amazing every time. I had to book a large table for a group of people and they were very accommodating especially considering I was forced to change the number of people twice - hence the time changes too. We ordered nearly everything on the menu and we happily ate everything. The waitress took my instructions to let my partner pay so it would make a good impression on my parents and for that, I am grateful for!",7/7/2018,5 star rating
367,Samantha M.,"Vancouver, BC","Consistently rated as one of the best in Vancouver for Japanese cuisine. It is one of the best, but very expensive! The view, service and experience are certainly worth it a couple of times. The desserts are really good, the sushi and sauces are brilliant,  the sashimi is always of the best quality.  Try it, it's worth the visit.",1/14/2020,4 star rating
368,Em W.,"Angels Camp, United States","Excellent service, especially from our server Carol! She knew the menu like the back of her hand and made the ordering process so much easier for us! (we were so overwhelmed by the many options!)While my boyfriend really liked the oshi sushi and Miku roll, it was just okay for me. The aburi prime though was sooooooo good! Also really enjoyed the coconut lychee and chardonnay grape sorbets.The restaurant itself is very nice, clean and classy. The staff is friendly and helpful all around. Be sure to make a reservation as this place is very busy and we were lucky enough to jump in after a cancellation! While this may be pricier than others, the quality of the fish and service is so worth it.",10/18/2019,4 star rating
369,Ed Y.,"Vancouver, BC","Definitely recommend the Lunch Shokai! It is good variety to try out the favourites! I love all of them, especially their Aburi. Service was great as the waitress described the ingredients thoroughly when the food was served. Only exception was when I walked in, the waitress at the front door had to give the up and down look 2x. When I was seated, I looked around and wondered if she does the same to the people wearing hoodies and sweat pants while I'm not even wearing those. Thanks a lot for the prejudice! Amazing view though!",12/16/2019,4 star rating
370,John V.,"Burnaby, BC",This is a fine dining unpretentious Japanese restaurant specializing in torched sushi (i.e. Aburi). Prepare yourself for not just the best fish dishes around but for a great dining experience. Of course the place looks great but for each and every single dish you get a rundown of what it is with some great and informative servers (like Tony!). Prepare to pay for such an experience though. Go for: a special and fun dining experience specializing in sushiDon't go for: if you are on a budget,5/21/2016,5 star rating
371,Melissa M.,"Las Vegas, United States","I would give this place 10 stars if I could!!Hands down amazing!! When I was visiting Vancouver for work a few of my friends that live there wanted to take me out and they had heard that this place was amazing and decided to take me- I'm so happy that they did!!We went on a Friday night around 6. Although it was quite busy we were seated rather quickly. I don't think there is a bad seat, we had a table by the window and it was close to the bar. Perfect for girlfriends to have cocktails and chat!Our server was fantastic. He helped us choose the perfect cocktails- they have so many to choose from. Explained the menu wonderfully and was very attentive the entire time. We had a few of their signature dishes- Ebi Fritters to start Aburi Sushi- we tried all 3 choices. The salmon was by far the best!One of my friends is gluten free and it was so great that they have so many options and showed great concern that it was to our liking when the dishes came out. Next time I'm in Vancouver this will be on the top of my list to return!!",3/11/2018,5 star rating
372,Joe T.,"Gainesville, United States","I decided to RSVP here for my birthday, and we were seated right away. This is my second experience at Miku, one at the Toronto location and my first time here.  Appetizer- Ebi fritters: I love this appetizer! The prawns were huge, juicy and piping hot! The batter was crispy and it made all the crunches. It was really delicious. Entree-Kaisen Soba Peperoncino: If I were to re-name the dish it would be ""chow mein with Japanese noodles"". It had the aroma and taste of chow mein, which, do not get me wrong, was not bad, but not worth the value at all! The only pro about this dish was the variety of seafood there was in it. I probably would not get it again.Aburi Oshi Sushi- This is their staple, and the reason why I came to Miku. I have had the Salmon and the Ebi. My first experience in Toronto tasted amazing. There was a perfect fish to rice ratio, and everything melted into my mouth. This time, the rice was cold and there was not enough salmon/Ebi so it tasted like I was just eating big chunks of cold rice. Sashimi Platter-Fish depends on the day. If I recall correctly, I got nine pieces of fish. Two of my disappointments - yellowtail was a little fishy, and sadly, Otoro!!! I have had way better. Not the best sashimi platter I ever had but overall it was good for the value, not amazing.Drinks- Moscow mule: My girlfriend regretted this. This was tasteless. Service: Excellent. Our waitress was very friendly, descriptive and patient with any questions we had. For my birthday, they also gave us a complimentary Daikon Scallop appetizer before dinner and a glass of sparkling champagne. Overall, I walked out disappointed and felt it was very mediocre after my girlfriend had spoke about this location for so long. My experience with tastes at the Toronto location was far better.",1/29/2019,3 star rating

374,Gary W.,"Burien, United States","This is somewhere were you can read all the great reviews on the food.  That said, you better have a reservation or it's going to be a bit painful to get into this place as a walk-in.  We were only in Vancouver BC for one night so we were committed to being a drop in and ended up sitting at the bar after a 30 or 40 minute wait (even though the exact bar seats were open when we check-in).  I'd say the reviews are a bit over the top for Miku as I've had as good if not better sushi in Seattle.  That said, the execution and service (once you're seated) is exceptional from the ordering to the staff giving you a great description of the food and the choices from the menu.   This is a place where your experience is in proportion to how much you spend.  If you can spend over $500 here you're going to have an exceptional experience.  If you cheap out, it's not so good.  You have to go all the way here.  Basically, go big or go home.",8/28/2016,4 star rating

What soy a sauce?Was soooo flavourful and delicious, a tad on the oily side, so if your dieting or watching your fat intake I'd skip some of the Arubi options!I found it interesting that they changed up the plates after each type of food was served... apparently they want you to get the full flavour experience and not accidentally dip the food in soy etc...I'd love to return with no kids",2/9/2019,5 star rating

378,Karina L.,"Boston, United States","[BOTTOM LINE / TIPS]Amazing, delicious, and special Japanese food paired with a beautiful view of Vancouver. A must do for tourists like us (and I imagine locals, too!). - We grabbed lunch at Miku and were able to get most of their best food for a cheaper price- Make reservations! We came here on a Thursday lunch and it was packed. [THE SPACE / SERVICE]It's huge. There's a large bar in the front, and the sushi bar is along the side. You can sit at both. The rest of the restaurant is separate tables that mostly run along full floor to ceiling glass windows.Can I mention how amazing the service was? Jason was fantastic, and even gave us suggestions on what to do in Vancouver (take the SeaBus across the harbor, etc.). It also happened to be my birthday and he snagged a beautiful dessert for me after confirming with the boyfriend that I am obsessed with chocolate.[THE FOOD]Jason, our server, was really helpful in navigating the menu. It's a little confusing, so definitely ask for help if you're confused.I highly recommend the MIKU ZEN -- which includes four smaller dishes and five pieces of Aburi sushi. It was the perfect serving for one person and you get the opportunity to taste all of their best dishes.EBI FRITTERS - GIGANTIC prawns in fluffy, puffy, delicious and salty batter. A must get. The Miku Zen only comes with two, so we actually ordered another serving of this so we wouldn't fight over it.SALAD - I forgot what the name is, but it came with mixed greens and this amazing vinaigrette. Think of the bad salads you get at sushi places and up it by 1000. BEEF - We got a beef and potato dish that was seasonal as well! I forgot what it was called but it was delicious and tender. Surprising a sushi place cooked this beef so amazingly.ABURI SUSHI - Their crown jewel. It's basically rectangular sushi that's 'torched' on top so the fish on top gets ooey, warm, crispy, and literally melts in your mouth. Completely amazing and also beautiful. Ours favorites were the salmon and the prawn. You'll get some of both in a Miku Zen.Overall, this was a fantastic experience. A must do for anybody coming for delicious sushi.",11/16/2017,5 star rating
379,Angel L.,"Burnaby, BC","Highly overrated. Good atmosphere, service was meh, and you can get the same quality food elsewhere for much cheaper (Satomi near Metro, Sushimoto near Holdom, and Victoria Sushi in New West, just to name a few). Most of what we ordered was too oily or too salty. Yes, even the sushi was oily...they also brush the pieces with soy sauce prior to bringing it to your table, so you don't have control over how much sauce you're using. I understand that it's a fusion type cuisine, but we had to down several cups of water after our meal.This is one of this try it once places for those suffering from FOMO, but there really isn't any reason to go back.",10/14/2017,3 star rating
380,Michelle L.,"Sacramento, United States","This place is fannncyyy. I'm glad we were able to make reservations for lunch on a Saturday because the restaurant filled up quick. We ordered the omakase lunch to try a variety of different things. The aburi comes with 8 pieces ($22) and premium comes with 12 pieces ($28).Both sets include their signature Aburi nigiri, which is a pressed, rectangle shaped nigiri that is torched. There is definitely more rice in the Aburi nigiri, and creamier than the traditional nigiri, but it was a nice change to the traditional nigiri. The fish was very fresh and tasted yummy. It can get overwhelming though, so a few pieces goes a long way.This is definitely a nice, elegant, modern restaurant, so be prepared to splurge. It's on the harbor, so there's a beautiful view if you're sitting by the window. Definitely would love to come again! I'd love to try their other dishes.

We had reservations here for a Saturday afternoon and even with a reservation, it still took a while to get our table ready. We didn't really mind--it just meant that it's a popular place! We basically came here since we heard it's the best sushi place and I was craving sushi. We both ordered the premium set and it came with a combo of traditional nigiri and their special rolls. Although I did enjoy the sushi, I wouldn't consider it anything amazing. I actually wish the set was all nigiris instead of the rolls.Nonetheless, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the sushi but pleasantly surprised that it wasn't that expensive.",10/17/2018,4 star rating
384,Jelizatin E.,"New Westminster, BC","The food is good here, but for the price you are paying we expected something unbelievable. We ordered several dishes, with the aburi sushi being our favourite. While we enjoyed it, we feel there are other restaurants around the city with better or just as good aburi sushi, and for much cheaper. The service was great, always refilling our water and checking on us regularly, but that is to be expected here. We are definitely in the minority here, but we would not come back.",2/18/2019,3 star rating
385,Jeana R.,"Reno, United States","We had just got done with climbing the grouse grind and we wanted to try a nice sushi place.Of course I looked on yelp to find a place nearby and Miku had the most reviews and it was 4 1/2 stars so I knew it was a must try.We walked in and automatically I felt like I needed to dress up better because we were gross and sweaty from the climb but they welcomed us and set us up at our seats. They explained everything on the menu and any questions we had they were able to help out since we have never ordered sushi that was all a cart since of course in Reno sushi is all you can eat.The waiter told us about there special sushi pieces that were flame torched with a smoke stick.  The technique is call aburi! We got the premium which consisted of 12 pieces of sushi and 6 of them the aburi style sushi. I also got the calamari and Alex got the fish and chips also. We did order a few orders of nigiri, $3,$4 for each piece so we tried to make sure we ordered exactly what we wanted to eat since it wasn't our usual AYCE sushi in reno. Oh my gosh!!!! A mouth explosion of flavors and amazement. The aburi style sushi was so amazing, although I have tasted almost the same at Sakana in our hometown. But anyway. It was so delicious, full of smokey flavor and each layer was such a compliment to one another. My mouth was happy dancing. The salmon and yellowtail nigiri was good, with the traditional way your supposed to make sushi where you add a smear, small smear of wasabi on the rice and then you lay the fish on top.But the aburi style sushi was just un explainably full of umami!! Mouth watering just thinking about it. The oddest thing though is after we ate we were stuffed to the max, and we normally can eat way more sushi. Maybe because the flavors satisfied all 5 or 6 flavor catagories. (Sweet, salty, savory, bitter, sour)? Not sure if that's correct but yeah I was so stuffed and I've been able to throw back a few. Haha. I would love to come back my the next time we visit. Oh and the ocean view seating! Amazing. Wow",9/13/2017,5 star rating
386,Ashley L.,"Walnut Creek, United States","Came here on a very special trip to Vancouver and was completely blown away by my friend's recommendation to eat here. The highlight was the aburi (half torched/seared) pressed sushi. The amount of vinegar in the rice was just right and the light smokey flavour of the torched fish really elevated this dish to something completely unexpected! I would fly back to Vancouver just to have a taste of this again- sadly I can't find anything close to this in SF. Finished the night off with the most wonderful dessert platter with the famous green tea opera cake, yum seconds please!!!",2/1/2018,5 star rating
387,Jamie F.,"Boston, United States","If you are visiting Vancouver, you absolutely must try Canadian-Japanese fusion cuisine featuring ABURI OSHI (flame-seared & pressed) SUSHI. Of course, the best place to try it is at the origin of where it all started...Miku. Plus, the scenic views and classy atmosphere are an added bonus. If Miku is fully booked, go to Minami (sister restaurant)!Recommend the following:1. NIGHTSHADE cocktail - pisco sour with a twist; the most beautiful cocktail I ever did drink!2. ABURI BEEF CARPACCIO - if Korean BBQ beef x hot pot beef x beef jerky had a threesome and made a miracle baby, this was it.3. MIKU SIGNATURE SELECTION (10 pieces) - recommend if you're indecisive like me. This platter included two signature aburi oshi (wild sockeye salmon and the prawn), plus various nigiri and maki pieces - all delicious, although a few pieces had a little too much wasabi hidden inside them. Fave pieces were definitely the aburi oshi - speechless by how good they were! I've had torched sushi before but this was on another level.4. GREEN TEA OPERA CAKE - this dessert was strikingly beautiful, and the varying textures and flavors will put your taste buds on a joy ride.I would pass on the Coal Harbor seafood platter unless you're really craving for raw bar / cold seafood. It was fresh but nothing special; highlight was the octopus ceviche.Our server was professional, attentive, and personable. He advised us on how to eat our sushi properly (no sauce). He apologized for the mistimed course pacing (they brought out our entree platters moments after we received our appetizers). Since we were tourists, he kindly gave us some suggestions for our trip. Lastly, he comped our dessert since we were celebrating our anniversary - so nice!",11/1/2017,5 star rating
388,Marisa F.,"Washington, DC, United States","Came for lunch. They have an amazing lunch menu for around 23 each with miso soup. I'd recommend the tart. But the best dish by bar here was the salmon Oshi. Buttery, light, heavenly. The addition of soy sauce takes away from this experience. We got seated at a tall table because we had no reservations so I'd probably recommend reservations. We had no wait though. We came right at 11:30 as it opened. For dessert, the green tee opera was spectacular. It had tons of parts : bar of shire chocolate , sugar glass, layers of cake and ice cream. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth the money.

392,Bonnie E.,"Phoenix, United States","Vancouver Sushi and Aburi-Style SublimeI skip around a lot. Just having written a review about a gyro in Chicago, what would make me think of sushi in Vancouver? I have no explanation, except to offer: it must be an amazing experience if it pops into my head after two weeks and while 1,777 miles away as the crow flies (according to Siri.)After reading a couple reviews here, I thought...""great, let's try it."" After reading a couple more, I thought, ""oh no, it's got to be a letdown. Too much going on about it.""Not a letdown! Even with ""high but hesitant"" expectations, I was blown away by the flavors of the aburi salmon oshi sushi. Very pleased the waiter suggested a half-order as I'd wanted to also try the beautiful aburi chirashi tart. (""Aburi describes their style of applying signature sauces after lightly torching the fish to awaken the flavors.  It works.) The hostesses were so pleasant as was my server. I appreciated his knowledge of their wines and the food offerings. I absolutely couldn't justify getting dessert as I was even taking a portion of the chirashi tart with me, but I have a mental note in giant letters and theatre bulb lights that is flashing ""dessert next time at the Miku!"" I really did wish for a just a hint of sweet and upon leaving, I found a simple little chocolate mint (akin to an Andes Candy or Fannie May thin mint, only better) at the hostess desk.  I'm of the opinion that EVERY restaurant in the world should be required to provide this offering, so to say ""I was pleased"" is an understatement.Perfection, Miku!",11/10/2015,5 star rating
393,Alexandria G.,"South Gate, United States",I'm from LA and don't really care for sushi that much or eat salmon but this place is really good and tried the salmon oshi and it was really good but my favorite was the prawn ebi oshi. Really loved the sushi,4/12/2019,5 star rating
394,Matt W.,"Santa Monica, United States","Miku has great aburi sushi, and is probably my second favorite sushi restaurant behind Minami. The menu was pretty much the same, but the only difference I could tell was the Miku was heavier on the sauces. Both are great places to go. At Miku I tried all of their Oshi Sushi, Ebi Fritters, Salmon Sashimi, and Unagi. I wanted to try their beef nigiri, but it is only available during dinner time. After visiting Minami, I definitely agreed with my server when she said they were known for their oshi sushi, which I prefered over their normal at minami. For their oshi sushi, there is salmon, prawn, and mackerel. By far, my favorite is the salmon. Their salmon oshi has two layers of salmon, with one on top and one in the middle. The fish is so fresh that biting through all the layers feels no resistance. The mackerel has a 'fishier' taste, and was so fatty it melts away. Lastly, I'm actually not a huge fan of their ebi (prawn) sushi. It has a lime sauce, that was a bit too strong and overpowered the fish flavor. The ebi fritters were good, but a bit too over sauced, and and sashimi was great. Similar to the fish quality of the oshi, the sashimi impresses with fresh fish. Overal, Miku is good if you like aburi style sushi heavy on the sauce. Compared to Minami, they do have a better location and a slightly more upscale feel due to the waterfront.",1/12/2018,5 star rating

The chef offered to substitute the red meat with lobster tail upon hearing my dietary restrictions. Every part of this meal was meticulously prepared, delivered, and explained to us. The timing in between portions was measured. And every single bite offered a new experience and mix of flavors. I definitely plan on going back next time I find myself in Vancouver.

398,Karina L.,"Coquitlam, BC","The stars are mostly for the service which was great! Ambiance: perfect lighting and view however seats were so squished that the table behind us felt like they were with us. View was nice, I understand why people like coming here.Food: food is okay, pretty good not going to lie, but in accordance with the price point? Ridiculous. For the price being paid I honestly expect a foodgasm in my mouth every bite!!! The seafood was not the best ive had yet it is 3 times the price of way better seafood. The mussels and clams were tiny, and tasted meh compared to some I had just last night. And this was from a $100 seafood platter. Moving onto mains, I cant believe they charge nearly $30 for a plate of soba i could definitely make at home. The steak was really yummy in my tables opinion (I personally dont like steak). And the sushi? Presentation was great, but I rather go to greenleaf sushi for the same quality. Lastly dessert tasted like any other bakery, id skip the dessert and head over to Thierry for some quality desserts! So basically nothing stood out for me.... maybe cause I was so conscious of the price, but it is hard not to be when you are a student! Service: really great! You can tell staff know their product and are really well trained and are the perfect amount of attentive and personable. If you want great service and overpriced food and a view, sure come to miku!

It was just as wonderful as it was a three years ago.The Aburi Chirashi Tart is packed full of flavor, the fresh fish, guacamole, and spicy sauce are all well balanced. There is really nothing quite like it.We also ordered the following:Miso Soup - nicely balanced and a great way to start the mealSeaweed Salad - fantastic amount of seaweed, not overly dressed, and extremely freshAburi Sashimi - absolutely fantastic, I really enjoyed the Aburi Prawn and Salmon.Assorted Sashimi - all of the fish here is extremely fresh and nicely slicedGreen Tea Opera Cake - it is almost like a green tea Ferroro Rocher.

401,Ritu K.,"Portland, United States","How is this restaurant so popular? It was packed at 8:30 with a line out the door. You figure a city like Vancouver would have the freshest fish imaginable in a sushi restaurant, but Miku was super disappointing. As far as location and ambiance its a 5 plus. I'm guessing this restaurant pulls in more of a tourist crowd, but it is very accessible from some major hotels and the views are spectacular. Service was very professional, although, our server was MIA once the food was served. As for the food, everything was a bummer. The oysters were quite possibly the smallest oysters I have ever seen (it was akin to a where's the beef commercial from the 80s). At $3.50 a pop that's just a crime. The hamachi carpaccio had some nice flavor, but there was definitely a fishy undertone to the whole thing. The nigiri was equally as fishy and the salmon oshi and miku roll had this awful sauce (miku sauce) that added a very unpleasant flavor to the fish. I was super excited about this meal as I had 7 days of cruise eats ahead of me, but this was a total bummer of a meal.",8/10/2019,3 star rating

406,Dianna H.,"Vancouver, BC","I absolutely love Miku. It's my favorite sushi place outside of Japan (which makes me super sad because it's so far from me).Their salmon aburi sushi roll is the bomb! It's the holy trifecta of their tasty house sauce paired with perfectly flavored and textured sushi rice and deliciously seared fresh salmon. I fell in love from the very first bite. Please do yourself a favor and order this roll!!The saba (mackerel) aburi sushi is really good as well, surprisingly. I'm usually not a big fan of saba, but with the way they prepared it I couldn't taste the normal fishiness of saba as much, and paired with their house sauce and their perfectly prepared sushi rice it was really tasty.For drinks I ordered my go-to cocktail which is an amaretto sour. My friends all tried it and agreed with me that it was delicious! My friend ordered the ebi fritter, which is essentially shrimp tempura, for her appetizer. I took a bite and it was the perfect combination of crunchy and soft textures. The shrimp they use are absolutely ginormous and makes for a nice and satisfying chew in your mouth. Highly recommend this as well!There are some options here for vegetarians as well. They have a garden roll which is all vegetarian, and even eggplant and sweet red pepper nigiri which I've never seen anywhere else before! Unfortunately they do not have tamago (egg) nigiri though.I saw pictures of the chirashi aburi tart on Yelp and wanted to get that, but unfortunately it's only available for lunch =(There is parking nearby but it's all metered till 10 pm at night. We had to pay $5/hour for our spot along the street, but at least we were only a block away!",5/31/2016,5 star rating
407,Doris H.,"Vancouver, BC","Came back to Miku for my anniversary after trying it out last year. If you're looking for high quality Japanese food this is the place to be! As usual the service is incredible and our server was extremely helpful and detailed in her explanations. We ordered the Kaisen which is a six course meal for $88 per person. Though like most high end restaurants where the portion sizing is generally quite small, the Kaisen was the perfect amount. Comes with starters, sashimi, appies, main, sushi, and then dessert. It's the chef tasting menu so it seems like it may change according to season. I love coming to Miku for a nice splurge every now and then. Great atmosphere and view and the food is absolutely fantastic. Can't wait to go back!",12/1/2017,5 star rating

410,Marios D.,"Manhattan, United States",From a view and overall experience perspective this is a 4 star.  From a food perspective it was average. Hence the 3 stars or 3.5....We had as series of appetizers and some of the specialties of the house.  I must say there is a lot of flare in the making of the sushi and its presentation.  Very nice.  I was not prepared for that and expected more of the NY style sushi that I have become used to.  Overall a good experience but I would encourage patrons to be warned of the style.I recommend this place.,11/27/2017,3 star rating
411,Melody C.,"East Grinstead, United Kingdom","We've been traveling all day and wanted to grab something nice to eat by our hotel. Miku was just a few mins away from our hotel and I was excited to give it a try. Got there on a Friday night before 6pm and were able to be seated right the way without reservation at the patio. They offered something off the menu for the kids it was soba noodle soup with chicken for $7. Great deal. Stole a few bites from my 2.5 yr old and it was pretty hearty. Ordered the Brussels sprouts which was surprisingly very tasty. The sockeye salmon sashimi which I've never had before, very fresh but I still prefer the fatty salmon better. Then came our miso fish which was amazing! The fish was super tender and flavor was great yet not overwhelming. Finally was our signature sushi plate (forgot what it was really called). You get a piece of each their signature roll, oshi sushi and nigiri. I loved it and each of the sushi had its own character even the garden roll was very unique.  We are definitely impressed with our first meal in Vancouver",4/26/2019,5 star rating

413,Alex R.,"Reno, United States","High end sushi in Vancouver! It was really good,  and very different from the all you can eat in reno.  Instead of whole rolls you got just pieces of the roll or nigiri piece.   A bit better visually than the best of the all you can eat places,  fancier bites too. I wanted a bit more selection In the menu,  and you can't get niri I  between the lunch and dinner service... sooo they can't do just a cut of fish with rice ... inbetween lunch and dinner.  But other than that this place is great.  I had fish n chips after we were past the lunch menu,  and it was very good.  Their tare tare sauce to go with it was okay.  Would totally go here again,  but for dinner or lunch menus",9/13/2017,4 star rating
414,Sarah C.,"Seattle, United States","I went here with my husband last night because last time I visited Vancouver I absolutely loved the pressed sushi.  I raved about it to my husband and was especially excited for the saba pressed sushi.   We arrived at 10:30pm for our reservation and we were seated right away.  The place was still busy but not extremely packed.  Previously when I came we arrived earlier and it was very full so I definitely recommend reservations if you're wanting to come at a more conventional dinner time.  It looked like the bar was pretty empty by this time. We thought we were going to try the signature selection which comes with one piece each of their 3 oshi sushis, a piece from 3 specialty rolls, and 4 different nigiri (so ten pieces total).  I believe I had this before and it was wonderful to try out so many different things.   The bummer thing is my husband is allergic to shellfish so we ended up changing our order since they couldn't substitute so many things from the signature plate to meet his needs which is totally understandable.   We decided instead to get calamari, salmon oshi roll, saba oshi roll, salmon roe nigiri, Hamachi nigiri, and a couple saba and unagi nigiri.  The food we received was delicious!  I'm not always a fan of nigiri, but when it's so clean tasting and tender I can get on board.   I really enjoyed the saba nigiri and unagi nigiri, although they were all so yummy.  The saba nigiri just had so much flavor!  The calamari wasn't too heavy and seasoned really well.  The squid was chewy but tender making it very pleasant.   Now onto the main event, the oshi!  The salmon was so creamy and flavorful.   It was everything I remembered and I was not disappointed in the least even with my high expectations.   We pretty much made the trip from Seattle for this sushi because I had been craving it since coming last time.   My husband hadn't tried it and I was worried I had hyped it up too much but he also loved it.  Now the saba oshi was what I had really come for and I could not wait for it!  But it never came.   Our server made a mistake and did not get the order into the kitchen.  The kitchen was only open for about 30 mins after our reservation, so by the time we ordered drinks, food, and asked about the missing oshi sushi the kitchen was closing up and apparently out of saba.   My heart fell when she came back saying they couldn't do anything about it that night.   We asked what could we do about the mistake because I really wanted that sushi.  We ordered dessert still because hey, why let a missing dish ruin your night.  When our server came back after talking to the manager she gave us a $20 gift card which at the time sounded good.  We thanked her, laughed, and accepted the apologies. After getting back to the hotel I realized that although super appreciative of the gift card I wish more had been done to remedy the mistake.  Like maybe the gift card could have been enough to cover the missed sushi and an appetizer because now we would have to fit an extra trip there to use the gift card.   Or maybe they could have also comped our dessert as well.   I was so surprised that the sushi was missed when the place is rated so highly and that it wasn't taken care of better. So overall, the food is delicious (5 star for sure) so I will probably go again but on this night I left feeling disappointed after having some time to think about how the mistake was handled.",12/22/2018,3 star rating

421,Keith M.,"Chattanooga, United States","The cocktails here were fantastic. The uni was very good. The A5 wagyu aburi nigiri and the o-toro aburi nigiri on the aburi prime tasting menu were good. The salmon oshi sushi was ok. Everything else was meh to not good. Honestly, though, the high ratings baffle me. This is overpriced sushi for people that haven't had a lot of sushi. My aburi was all cold. What's the point of flame searing a fish to bring out the oils and then letting it get stone cold before serving it? Nigiri should be served at body temp and aburi really should have a little residual warmth. The real killer, though, is the sushi rice was cooked nicely but had way too much sugar in it which threw the balance off on almost every single piece. This is critical because everything we ate tasted overly sweet.The service at the bar was good. Be careful of the wait though if you don't make reservations. We were told 45 minutes and got the text in less than 10.",11/18/2018,2 star rating

Funky Caesar fusion too but watch out for the wasabi in it!",4/6/2016,4 star rating
423,Derek L.,"Aurora, ON","Incomparable.  This was probably the best sushi this sushi addict has ever enjoyed!  First off, this is more of a fusion style sushi, with a number of dishes I have not seen on other menus.  The Red Wave Roll, for instance was new to me.  Its flavour and balance was something you can't get it traditional sushi.  Often I find that a sushi place that tries to be ""fusion"" puts together a variety of ingredients that clash badly--not so here!Second, the quality of sushi is impeccable.  Every other traditional sushi restaurant serves a nice salmon, but this is the first time I had the bright orange Sockeye salmon.  The flame seared Salmon Oshi Sushi was also an amazing morsel.So, a couple of different rolls, a couple different sashimi combos, and a miso soup hit the 4 of us for just north of $200.  Not a $15 a head AYCE.  Not a $22 sashimi platter.  A premium price for a premium product.

426,Jennie C.,"Arcadia, United States","Unique offerings is what should entice you to at least try this establishment out once while in Vancouver. The restaurant does see a lunchtime rush so plan accordingly. No reservations are taken in advance but they do have a nice wrap around bar with ample table surface to accommodate the variety of dishes on their menu. The menu is split into appetizers and then categories of what they are known for - signature samplers of nigiri, sashimi, rolls and this hot/cold sampler called Miku Zen. Also popular is Mikey's version of Chirashi which is laid out like a tart with layers of rice, crushed sashimi, creamy wasabi mayo, ebi, scallop and roe. My friend and I tried the Miku Zen and the the Abuti Chirashi Tart. The Miku Zen was 4-tapas sized sampling of the restaurant's well known dishes like the shrimp fritter, the spicy tuna salad, the cold chicken salad and the Sake Soy Glazed Obie Brazier. The hot dishes are paired with a 5-sushi sampler which was just okay. Overall the restaurant is considered pricey for what it offers but it's definitely a nice experience of an eclectic presentation of traditional Japanese food.",9/20/2018,4 star rating
427,Ann D.,"Renton, United States","This is a delayed review, but I had to post it because this was one of the most incredible meals I've ever eaten, and I don't say that lightly.I went here back in July and sampled their summer menu with my parents and boyfriend.At that time, the summer fixed price menu included:- a little ""bento box"" style plate with four divisions: 1) tuna and seaweed tartare with avocado, sesame vinagrette 2) sous vide chicken breast with kale, pickled tomato and cucumber, spicy sesame ponzu sauce - probably the most ""normal"" dish, didn't wow, but was well executed  3) north cove oyster tempura with home made tartar sauce - which was really delicious, fat and juicy and 4) halibut with quinoa salad, mustard miso pesto- a sushi dish with salmon oshi sushi (this was by far my favorite thing I ate here and my favorite thing overall - fatty, smooth, flavorful, delightful flavors) and ebi oshi sushi with pressed prawn- miku roll with salmon, crab, cucumber, and tobiko- red wave roll with prawn, avocado, red tuna- raw sampling of otoro nigri, hotate nigri (this was AMAZING), hamachi nigriAll of the above was perfectly executed and very good.I ordered the Aburi Chirashi tart ($22) with layers of sushi rice, spicy tuna, avocado, sockeye salmon, Miku sauce, flame seared, topped with prawn, scallop, tobiko, and ikura.  This was phenomenal.  It was cream, savory, sweet, and filling, and the fish flavors popped with freshness.For dessert, the summer prix fixed menu came with a black forest tiramisu with sour cherries and coffee ice cream.  This was very good with delicate, harmonious flavors.My mom ordered the ""fromage blanc et fruit rouge"" which is a not-so-interesting name for an mind-blowingly delicious dessert.  The jasmine custard cake on puff pastry had a tart rasberry gelee and citrus fromage chantilly, with perfectly berries and a refreshing yogurt grand marnier sorbet.  HIGHLY recommend.I ordered the green tea opera with dark chocolate ganache, azuki bean cream, hazelnut wafer, and matcha ice cream.  This was also quite tasty.  Overall our meal was great, with friendly service, a beautiful view of the water, and clean bathrooms.  I'd be happy to come back next time I'm in town.",10/31/2017,5 star rating
428,Mario N.,"Rockville, United States","I saw the very good Yelp reviews and consulted with my hotel's front desk, where I was assured that this Japanese restaurant would be very good. Unfortunately, I cannot agree. First, I was received by a quartet of robotic hostesses that immediately wanted to seat me at the sushi bar (because I was one person). I have seen this tactic before in Japanese restaurants, and did not bode well for this establishment. After a 15 minute wait (there were several places open at the sushi bar, but I asked, so I was made to wait),i was approached by a very nice server (two of my three star reviews go to her!). The menu read not traditional at all, with things like pressed salmon and other items not belonging to a real Japanese restaurant. The server suggested their version of a lunch bento box, which was quickly brought (suggesting ready made items). One of the items was a soyu-braised beef which was hard as a rock and impossible to flake with chopsticks. The rest of the ""sushi"" were flavorless and boring. This restaurant seems to serve a heavily Westernized version of Japanese food, adapted to the Vancouver children of Asian immigrants and other multicultural strands so common in a Vancouver. If you are looking for an authentic experience, this is definitely not it.",9/3/2018,3 star rating

I ordered the omakase sushi set: very very disappointing. My dad ordered the steak, it was so-so, thankfully my mom ordered the sable fish dish and she thought it was tasty.

437,Alyssa B.,"Kennebunk, United States","I don't think there's much to say that hasn't been said, but I will say it anyways!I had made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for two of us at 7pm on a Sunday. Upon arriving I asked about a table outside, but unfortunately there were none available. The hostess was super friendly and said she had a lovely table next to the windows which I appreciated.Our amazing waitress promptly took our drink orders and returned with them only a minute later. She then explained the whole menu with lovely descriptors and our mouths were already watering.We opted to start with yellowtail and salmon sashimi. I loved that they were able to do half orders, so each of us had 3 pieces (rather than 6). The salmon melted in my mouth and may have been the best salmon sashimi I've ever had.We then tried the shrimp fritters which, I can't properly explain in words how delicious they were. A thick crunchy batter and a creamy aioli complimented big (hot) shrimp. The order normally comes with 5, but she asked if we'd like one more for an even number. We said yes, THANK GOD! Yum.We then had their famous aburi salmon sushi which, like many have said before me, absolutely melted in our mouths. Even the rice was the best sushi rice I've had. I dream of that roll.The only lackluster thing we are was the surf and turf roll which was a shrimp and cucumber roll topped with tenderloin. It was good, but after the aburi, didn't come close.Drinks were fantastic, wine was great, and I really hope I will travel to Vancouver again simply to dine again at Miku!!",9/5/2015,5 star rating

442,Shera I.,"Richmond, BC","As a local, I've been to Miku several times since its inception. Recently I went for dinner with some out-of-town guests, and the last time before that was probably five years ago. The reason for this huge gap between visits is mainly because food is overpriced for the quality and quantity you receive as well as the service. Other than the first time I visited, which was the first time I tried aburi sushi, I've never been impressed with the taste of the food I've had there. I find myself disappointed once again this time for the food I got based on the price I paid. Honestly if I wanted aburi sushi I'd just visit Green Leaf Sushi. The aburi sushi there taste the same if not better. Everything else that I've had at Miku was otherwise so-so and not worth the price they charge. Oh and we waited approximately 15-20 minutes after our reserved dinner slot. For this price honestly service should be without a hitch.I won't be visiting again unless it's a paid meal and suggested by someone else.",6/17/2019,2 star rating

Due to the high focus on seafood, my options were limited with good cause. Place is a little hard to find. It got really busy at 6. Almost a 45 minute wait but I was seated right away at the bar since it was only me. I was being a little anti-social cause most were business people talking business. I did have a few rich Asian guys from Japan try and buy me drinks which was amusing cause that would never happen in the real world where locals would talk to me.It's a 5 star place for sushi, therefore, you're paying for the best sushi in Vancouver (at least one of the places).I stuck to my veggie sushi with two different soy sauces.My sushi was really nicely platted which is expected for what I paid.Decent ambiance although loud. Beautiful painted fish on the upper walls.Kitchen was backed up but was served in 15 minutes. While I was waiting I just read a few Batman comics.For most of the dishes the bowl is bigger than the pieces.Just an FYI that they don't do substitutions or removals which meant that I couldn't be experimental with my selection due to shrimp allergy.",8/4/2015,5 star rating

447,Victoria E.,"San Francisco, United States","I was minding my business tonight when the FB messenger blinked. I had no idea who the person was, but curiosity ate the cat. I opened up the message. It was from someone I met on a Air Canada flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver. He was a very good looking man who was also very charming with the stewardesses. He wrote, ""I remembered you. Sorry for losing in touch. How are you?"" I messaged him back. ""I was just at Vancouver. And I ate at Miku.  Really amazing place."" I like Vancouver. It has good food. I like the people. They are friendly. Of the three places I often frequented in Canada: Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary, I'd venture to say Vancouver has the best seafood.Miku took the crown for Aburi style sushi, one that San Franciscans have yet to catch on. Aburi in this case means flame seared technique with their special sauces. Whatever they were, it was beyond delicious. Nothing like that existed in San Francisco, which makes this place a super duper keeper.If you are in the mood for sushi but have trouble deciding, get a sampler sushi and then a sampler sashimi.As you know, when eating sushi, the more money you spend, the better quality in general you'd expect to receive. This is no exception. Food is going to be expensive, but you get what you pay for.There is nothing here that is just normal. Everything is superbly delicious. But if you are pressed for time, get this and this only. Aburi sushi sampler and Aburi sashimi sampler. I ended my missed-connection email to the guy who IM's me from Vancouver, ""Miku has great food. Go if you have not been.""",6/8/2015,5 star rating
448,Veronica H.,"Surrey, BC","This was an out of body experience. If you're anything like the other millions of Vancouverites in this province and you love sushi, Miku is your mecca.Salmon Aburi Oshi is the first thing that should be on your list of must haves and is a fan favourite and rightly so. The best thing I had all night and will definitely go back to miku- even just for this alone. UH-MAZING. Ebi Fritters were out of this world- the thickest, juiciest ebi prawn I will ever have in my life; and that sauce? UNF. Premium Nigiri was melt-in-your-mouth delish and allowed me to try a variety of different fish that I've never had before (yellowtail, mackerel, etc)Miku Roll was so classically elegant. A simple tuna, crab, and cucumber rolled in fish eggs that popped in my mouth like pop rocks.and to finish it off- Matcha Lemonade???? Who would've thought??? But- by golly- is it delicious. If you're looking for a nice classy place to bring your beau for a special meal (thanks, bf) - this is the place.",11/17/2017,5 star rating
449,Deepika K.,"Altadena, United States","Hi,I am from LA ,California here in Vancouver for work.I tried this restaurant Miku and the service was amazing .The aburi sushi is amazing and it's enough for one person. It was highly recommended and it is done very well. The place is nice,gets crowded and busy even on weekdays by 5 pm. It's a must come restaurant!!!",9/26/2019,5 star rating
450,Ahmed B.,"Seattle, United States","This place would be a 5 in another city, but in Vancouver it's a 4. The reason for that is while the sushi is really good here--the sushi in Vancouver is probably the best outside of Tokyo, so in that sense I took off a star. The service here is really attentive and friendly. The views are one of the best as you are by the pier, so you get beautiful views of the snow capped Vancouver mountains. As a result, it's a bit pricey--you are paying for location as well as good food. Parking is really annoying, but that's not their fault--it's downtown life.I would hughly reocmmend the Oshi Sushi.",12/3/2018,4 star rating
451,Jill F.,"Los Angeles, United States","4.5 stars for Miku.Three of us walked in without reservations on Sunday around 7 pm. There was an approximately 40 minute wait  and they texted us when a spot opened up at the bar.We got the fried calamari appetizer for $10-14 (sorry I forget the exact price, but it's probably on a Yelp menu). This was delicious. 5 stars.We each got the $55 Aburi Prime, Miku-version-of-Omakase, a 9 piece sushi set, which is what this review is based on (4.5 stars). They gave it to us all on one plate and once but told us to eat left to right and work downward. The red snapper was first and amazing. The tuna was next and also good. The mackerel was a little fishy, but that's the way mackerel usually is. Then came salmon, albacore (I think), and toro. This row was nice, but nothing amazing: the salmon and otoro were not especially creamy or fatty.  I liked the albacore best for what it was. The last row was scallop, lobster, and wagyu. Scallop and lobster were nice. Wagyu was interesting. I've never had that on sushi. I've also had wagyu that melts in the mouth (but at a steak house so perhaps a sushi place should not be compared), and this was not that. But it had nice flavor, like everything else. Nothing was bad, and some things were amazing. It was worth the try, and I would get it again. Our server told us the chefs spent a year and a half developing this sushi set. They did a wonderful job.Update: 4 stars!Cane on Friday at 8:30 pm and waited 45 minutes without reservations. Got seated on the patio. This time we got the sashimi set (8 pieces of sashimi for about $25). The set included a tiny poke bowl (yummy), tuna, albacore (yummy), yellow tail (fishy), raw shrimp with option to fry head afterwards, scallop (yummy), salmon (too fishy, good salmon is usually creamy), and mackarel (very fishy). Also got individual nigiri pieces: kampachi was super good and is my favorite thing here; we also ordered eel (people who like the grilled eel taste over the sweet taste will probably like this. I thought it was a-okay, just not special).",7/31/2018,4 star rating
452,Annie D.,"Mercer Island, United States","Nice fancy place to try in Vancouver. All the chefs shout in Japanese whenever a guest enters and leaves, that was a fun to be greeted. I tried the peach vanilla mint mojito (soft cocktail), fish and lotus root chips, garden roll, chocolate orange dessert. The dessert wasn't that good, but the rest of it tasted pretty great. Peach vanilla mint mojito was my favorite- it's a gentle perfect balance of flavors.",12/1/2018,4 star rating
453,Crystal C.,"Vancouver, BC","Miku is me and my boyfriend's go-to restaurant for a relaxing, romantic date night. We celebrated our anniversary here a couple years ago and it was an amazing experience. We went on a Thursday night and surprisingly it was very busy. Our server was very engaging and friendly. When our food arrived, she asked if we've been to Miku before and we said no. She then explained, in details, what each dish consisted of. Even though it was probably part of her job to ask, we felt like she was very genuine in the way she described the dishes. We went back to Miku a couple more times - once for lunch and another time for Valentine's Day. After dining there for a few times, we realized that Miku is always busy. If you're thinking of eating dinner there or to celebrate a special event, please make reservations weeks ahead!!",11/3/2018,5 star rating
454,Erika S.,"Clarkdale, United States","Just ate at Miku for our first time and our experience could not have been more special. Of course the food, sake, and atmosphere were all amazing, but it was our server Lynn who made our time extra special. Lynn provided tons of knowledge about the menu/sake and had awesome suggestions to match all of our particular wishes around sake types. We also received a special anniversary dessert which I had forgotten I'd even mentioned since I booked 6 months out.

456,Tiffany S.,"San Francisco, United States","The first place I ate at in Vancouver! Came in after a long day of biking around Stanley Park around 4. The host told us there was only a bar and snack menu available until dinner service started at 5:30 so we reserved a table and hung out at the Fairmont across the street to kill time. I would've hung out at the restaurant if they had HH but they didn't. The host did recommend their sister restaurant Gyoza Bar but I wasn't interested. They gave us a booth by the waterfront and it was absolutely gorgeous! We thought it would be dead since it was a Sunday night but it was packed by the time we left and this restaurant is huge! Its so big I feel like there are different experiences if you sit at different spots in the restaurant. We didn't order any appetizers and instead went straight for the nigiri and rolls. I think the veggie roll was my favorite along with the dessert. Ordered a scoop of maple miso just because it sounded the most unique and it came all decked out! Covered in fresh fruit and chocolates. Great touch! I wanted the sampler but my boyfriend wasn't hungry enough. Boo. There was a table next to us that brought their own booze and they wouldn't let them open it even with a corkage fee. So weak so don't think about bringing your own alcohol here. Don't know if thats a Vancouver thing or what. I see a couple reviews about noisy kids here. While this is a more upscale restaurant, its definitely family friendly spot. I was there in a t-shirt and leggings and didn't look out of place. Ordered a lychee martini (sake + vodka). It was strong but it looked like the glass was half full. Never got a drink like that but they do emphasize their cocktails are only 2oz. Theres probably a reason for that. Hard to get a hold of the waitress to refill hot water for the tea but the bus boy was on top of it. Around $100 (USD) for dinner for two including one cocktail. While this place was good, I went to a bunch of sushi restaurants throughout the week and never thought the sushi here was better than anywhere elses. Paying for the ambiance.",5/9/2015,4 star rating

459,Bron J.,"Mount Pleasant, Vancouver, BC","FOOD/DRINK:  47/50I have to admit, I'm a little bit sad. Why? Because as I'm writing this, I'm not eating Miku sushi. I know. The struggle is real.A pricey sushi option but you get what you pay for. This is up there with the best sushi I've ever had. Home of the famous flame-seared sushi technique for some of their options. Incredibly fresh. Enthusiastically cared for. A well thought out menu. Creative. Fun. If you're looking for a positive sushi experience in Van, this is one of the first I'd recommend. Just ask for whats the most popular and you will be lead to many sushi mouthgasms. You're welcome.SERVICE/SUPPORT STAFF:  30/30Our server was an absolute boss. To be honest, he was one of the best servers I've ever had. Quinn was friendly, outgoing, charming, authentic, and respectful of our space as we were there for lunch celebrating my birthday. He knew when to come in and offer us our next order and knew when to give us space to have our quality time. We did not feel rushed at all which I really appreciated. Very relaxing. Gold star, Quinn. Gold star, indeed, fine sir!ENVIRONMENT/VIBE:  20/20Miku is located in the business district of Vancouver so it attracts a lot of professional clientele, and the environment heavily supports it. I watched the staff preparing food in their open faced kitchen and I could tell it was a team of people who took pride in what they were doing. It gave off a very healthy vibe that could be trusted amongst all our fish eating friends. All in all, much appreciated!OVERALL EXPERIENCE:  97/100They're doin it right! Highly recommend!

The fish was fresh with a great selection of Salmon, Toro, Hamachi and Hawaian tuna.

466,Tracy P.,"Midway City, United States","I will have to say that my second time here was a little disappointing. I've been here before and from my memory I really enjoyed it, maybe the chef was having an off day the second time around? I ordered the famous salmon and ebi oishi sushi: a little lack luster, it was decent but nothing amazing. I also ordered the aburi sashimi selection, which comprises of the chef's selection of three sashimis with a variety of sauces; I only really enjoyed one of the three because the other two were overpowered by a strawberry and pistachio sauce. But I suppose that you at least get a lovely view of the water and Canada Place.Overall I think the only reason I would come back to Miku is for the lovely view and ambiance, other then that, I prefer the oishi sushi at Minami a little better.",6/1/2017,3 star rating
467,Caryn C.,"Lindenhurst, United States","Definitely a must go if you are in Vancouver. Being from NYC I have had my fair share of sushi but Miku is quite different and unlike the others. My fiance and I had lunch here and it was such a treat for us. We got a booth table over looking the water and it was relaxing and beautiful. I was not sure about the portions and told myself not to order a lot so I ordered the following:We got the Miku ZenSalmon Oshi Sushi 1/2 Miku Roll, and 1/2 Red Wave RollMiku Zen- order this, just do it, you are missing Instagram worthy pics if you dont order this. And this item allows you to experience a little of everything, and everything was great. Salmon Oshi Sushi- their most popular roll, pressed salmon sushi that melts in your mouth, you get more of this in the Miku ZenMiku Roll and Red Wave were both great but they were also in the Miku zen so I felt like we couldve not ordered this and instead ordered something else.

Everything is fresh - you can't go wrong!My party also ordered various appetizers - ebi (shrimp) fritters are a fun take on tempura, and the farm tofu salad was the perfect zesty opener before the sushi.In addition to amazing food, service is top-notch as well.

471,Jessica I.,"Markham, ON","The assorted sushi platter was a great way to try the various types of rolls served at Miku. The location was decently busy at 8:00pm on a Monday (Thanksgiving) night. The staff were very warm and friendly - greeting you with a shout as you come in as many Japanese restaurants do. Since the restaurant was full, the food did take a little longer to arrive. The salmon oishi roll was the best - rich combination of flavours and fresh tasting fish. Instead of just tasting different flavoured mayo with fish and rice, the sauce topping did not overwhelm the taste of the fish. I can definitely see why it is the top choice for so many people. Each roll had it's own unique flavour. While it was good to try everything out, I'll likely just order the salmon oishi roll the next time I come.",10/18/2019,4 star rating

Had the chance to sit right in front of the sushi chefs assembling/torching sushi.Every one in the restaurant was very knowledgeable and accommodating.Since it was our first time, we decided to go with the Shokai under Kaiseki and ordered a bit of extra nigris on the side. Everything was cooked/made to perfection! At one point, our mains were taking a bit longer, the manager came over and offered us some free miso soup and apologized for the wait (with our server and food runner also apologizing).The Miso Sablefish was melt in your mouth, cooked to perfection and not too salty. The half lobster tail tasted amazing. My friend raved about the lobster tail all night long. The nigiri was also was a melt in your mouth experience (Like hooooolly mouth gasm).My favorite dishes that I would order again would be the Salmon Oshi (AMAZING). All ingredients used were very fresh. Would definitely come back and try the other stuff as well as the lunch menu! Oh don't forget to grab a chocolate mint on the way out.",11/26/2017,5 star rating

Great looking interior, though a bit noisy, While the emphasis is sushi, all other dishes are prepared to perfection as are their great tasting cocktails and desserts which are artistically presented. I had a  sushi sampler that did not disappoint. The quality of the seafood is the best and freshest you can find. Portions appear to be small, but were adequate and quite filling. We shared appetizers of Pickled Market Vegetables and an order of the Fraser Valley Chicken Nanban. We were off to a great start. My wife ordered the sablefish which had a very delicate, mild flavor and seasoned to perfection. Of course we had to leave room for dessert. Desserts were works of edible art, especially the Green Tea Opera:  not one morsel left. Bring your wallet, but it is well worth it.",5/13/2017,5 star rating

This was surely the best meal of our trip and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sushi.,8/12/2019,5 star rating
476,Daniel V.,"Dallas, United States","My wife and I came to Miku twice during our short stay in Vancouver. Food- Hands down, this is the best sushi and nigiri I have ever had in my life. The calamari broke down easily, perfectly cooked and no hint of rubbery texture that often accompanies calamari at a variety of other restaurants. Aburi crudo was light and refreshing, the compressed grapes and serrano coulis perfectly balanced the dish.Miku Signature Selection featured a great variety of the restaurant's menu and was a fantastic way for us to experience an array of food the restaurant had to offer. We ordered two more rolls based off the selections on this plate.Miku Roll - fresh, light, great pop of flavor from the roe.Garden Roll - I am a carnivore through and through, but I honestly would have had no issue if i was told the kitchen ran out of fish for the evening and all they could make was this roll.Salmon Oshi - very very neat twist on the type of sushi we are used to in TX. I'd never heard of Aburi style sushi until we came to Miku. Torched and light smoke from what i believe is a piece of lump charcoal maybe.. the salmon was delicious, and the jalapeno on top really went a long way to giving the sushi a gentle bite.Ebi Oshi - tender prawn pressed flat against the packed rice, salt and citrusy bite - very goodAburi Prime - wife and i shared this - its omakase, but hey, trust the chefs, they know exactly what they are doing. I won't pretend to remember all the fish we were served and how they were prepared. All i can tell you is the omakase option was unbelievably good and i would do it again in a hearbeat.Red Tuna Nigiri - our waiter suggested we try this seared and boy was he right. Just an incredible bite and a perfect way to end our main course.Green Tea Opera Cake - had so many elements and flavors all well balanced and complimentary of the next. Perfect way to end our meal without feeling like we ate a pound of sugar.Service- Incredible service. I love restaurants where it seems everyone there is genuinely happy to see you there and cares greatly about your experience. I don't think my water glass was empty even once in the approximate 4 hours total I spent at Miku. It was almost as if everyone took responsibility for each guest's experience instead of just passing off the responsibility onto someone else. Pretty much anyone that came to our table had a neat little oyster of information about something interesting to share with us, or a gentle suggestion - all of which were great.- I am having a hard time remember our waitress's name the second night (she was awesome) but our first night and part of our second, we were taken care of by Lenny - what a great asset to this restaurant. Completely personable guy, great conversation, wonderful suggestions. Did a great job of recommending various dishes but did it in such a gentle, unrushed way - not too many restaurants understand the importantance of not being pushy - Miku gets it. Hats off to Lenny.DrinksAnother A+. Seaspan Margarita - Well done, classic margarita - loved the sweet and light spice of the vanilla on the salted rim.Kir Royale - light, crisp, refreshingMai Tai - this was a tad too sweet in my opinion, but good nonethelessFrench 75, sub JR Smith's favorite for the gin - very good, well balanced, refreshingBergamot Sour - this was the show-stopper for me. This drink had everything. Pomelo for a bright citrusy note, earl grey for the bergamot, amaretto which gave a light nutty flavor, egg white to make it light and crisp, whisky to round everything out, and togarashi on the rim - look up togarashi cause there are too many ingredients for me to type here.AmbianceWonderful, very welcoming. The whole restaurant welcomes each guest as they walk into the restaurant. I asked our hostess the meaning and she said its pretty much everyone in the restaurant saying ""welcome"" to their guest.The restaurant itself is absolutely immaculate. Everything, and i mean everything is spotless. The first night at the bar gave us a glimpse of almost the entire kitchen. It was wonderful watching the care and attention each member of the staff put into their work. The seating at the bar was comfortable, but keep in mind if you're there for more than an hour, you may start feeling like you need to get up and stretch for a little, as the stools are only comfortable for about an hour or so - no big deal thoughBooth near the window - fantastic. Great views of the water, large windows.Miku is very likely the second best dining experience i've had in my life, only losing to LeBernardin. The next time I am in Vancouver I'll be here again - twice!",5/20/2019,5 star rating
477,Jin H.,"San Jose, United States","Money does buy you happiness, because Miku is happiness itself. Honest opinion, this place isn't actually that expensive, for small eater you probably only end up with $40-60CAD per person with one drink. It only gets bad if you got some lard bucket friend like me.This place does changes menu depending on season, so this review might be outdated real fast. Food:Sashimi lunch special - I think Sushi Gen in LA got this one beat in quantity and quality, sorry. Unfortunately my plate is just alright, 2 piece of akami, hotate, mackerel, hirame. While the pieces are decent i don't think it's worth $30CAD. but sashimi is a YMMV kind of deal, some time you might find the best goddamn sake nigiri at some random japanese restaurant but won't be the same again the next week. Tapa plate - now that one is special. That hipster tempura was some next level tempura that i ever had. Whatever that sauce is, it is some crazy good sauce. The slow cooked beef, salad, and halibut was also decent and unique experience. They did a really good job with pairing the sauces and balancing the flavors.the super popular salmon roll was probably the best. perfect sweetness n perfect amount of fat on the salmon combined with the secret miku sauce makes it great filler meal. If you're here on a budget, just fill up with the salmon roll, you won't go wrong.Calamari was also a surprise too,  super moist inside yet crunchy texture on the outside. hefty portion and goes amazing with beer as you sit on the patio outside.overall, this place is pretty great, not mind blowning amazing but it's one of the better option if you got money but don't know where to go.the line might be ridiculous so get a reservation and enjoy the outdoor view.",8/24/2017,4 star rating

479,Clara H.,"Burnaby, BC","Being the sister restaurant to Minami, I personally enjoy Minami more but Miku is still one of the better fine dining sushi joints you can find in Vancouver. My reason for choosing Minami over Miku is that their infamous Salmon Oshi, I find tastier over at Minami. However for a better view and atmosphere, I would choose Miku. Miku does offer a better menu selection than Minami does in my opinion. However my preference still stands simply because of the salmon oshi and the miso sablefish. Also, I do want to point out that I don't think party dinners at Miku is a great idea as their set menu selection is disappointing in comparison to choosing a la carte. And there was also a spider that ran out the food on my plate during one party occasion. Other than that, never had any issues here.",8/16/2017,4 star rating

It was the most I've ever spent in a sushi restaurant, so it better damn be good.Miku is located by the waterfront near Canada Place, and they are opening a Toronto branch soon! Reservations are pretty much mandatory; I was lucky to be able to reserve via email since I didn't wanna call long distance. Someone in the restaurant will call you the afternoon beforehand to confirm your reservation, so do keep your phone in handy.We ordered the following items:- Aburi beef carpaccio- Kaisen soba pepperoncino- Sockeye salmon sashimi, aburi- Sashimi platter of ~20 pieces- Premium aburi nigiri- Miku roll- Pan seared Alaskan scallopsFull marks go out to the aburi beef carpaccio, premium aburi nigiri, and the miku roll; my whole family agreed these three dishes stood out in our entire meal. This was followed by the kaisen soba pepperoncino (especially the scallops!) and the sashimi orders, which were also very good in its own regard. Our disappointment of the meal was the pan seared Alaskan scallops, because...it just wasn't anything special compared to everything else we ordered.Service was excellent the entire time, and I really liked how the servers not only tell you the dish when serving you, but the ingredients in the dish as well.

483,Anthony Surya W.,"Seattle, United States","We were fortunate enough to be seated at the sushi bar without reservation just 15 minutes after it opened (the waiting time is nuts from that point on). Either make a reservation if you wish for a table or come early if you don't and be open to sit anywhere.We ordered the premium roll, the garden select ,the salmon & saba aburi rolls. For dessert we have the dark chocolate gateau & green tea opera. The sushi was fresh and everything is delightful. The fish and rice both has a subtle buttery feeling to your mouth, and that might be what held the sushi together. At times though the sushi failed to hold together and fell apart as we were about to dunk them into the soy sauce.And not sure if it's actually the authentic way, but they do not provide soy sauce alongside your sushi unless you ask. Be aware that the wasabi is already inside the nigiri, but as for me it's still bearable enough to mind about the fish taste.As for the dessert, they are pleasing but what I like more is how they paid attention to detail in terms of the presentation.Expect to pay a bit of a premium compared to your average sushi place, but if you want another way to enjoy sushi using a ""modern"" cooking method and detailed service, come here!",12/26/2017,4 star rating
484,Clinton K.,"Burnaby, BC","I invited my friend to come have sushi since I was working inside Canada Place. So we were hungry and I wanted to get some lunch. After looking at the menu, we both got the Premium  Sushi Lunch Special which was a combination of Oshi Sushi, Nigiri Sushi, Aburi Nigiri. I enjoyed the fresh nigiri sushi. As a reminder, there is wasabi underneath the fish so be careful because it will clean your nostrils. The best part of the dish I would say is probably the Salted Saba Oshi Sushi. While it was very fresh, there was an element of sweetness I was not expecting and it complimented beautifully with the cured Saba. The red roll was fresh and reminded me of like a rainbow roll you would normally get from Whole Foods. The salmon oshi was their signature sushi at Miku and I find it to be good, but I think the jalapeno could be a option for those who wanted spicy. It was good with or without it. The Aburi Nigiri was designed very well as one of the pieces resembled seeing bones of a fish as if you were checking yourself through the raditation process at the doctor's office.Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Miku and would definitely recommend the place who wants to experience a great view of Vancouver and enjoy the sushi.My one wish was that I wish the service was a tad bit faster.",2/10/2017,4 star rating

Cant complain bc that's all I need to eat dinner with my hubby on his business trip. Love the food and ambiance of Miku. You can have a beautiful view of the ocean and mountains from the restaurant. I ordered the omakase for 2 people and it was perfect. Probably will come back soon.",6/3/2018,5 star rating
486,Jess N.,"Orange County, United States","Downtown restaurant specializing in Aburi (seared) sushi. This restaurant was recommended by family and locals that live in Vancouver. I really wanted to love this place and just couldn't. Offering a beautiful view and large space, it's definitely a treat for those looking for a fun date night location. This place is easily accessible by car and by public transportation.The aburi (seared) box sushi was very pretty to look at but the rice was on the wet side and fell apart which made it very difficult to eat. The service wilted in my eyes as the evening progressed. The Kagoshima Wagu nigiri did not look appealing and the sear did not improve the visual appearance or taste. Overall, I was not all that impressed. I did enjoy the gyozas and am so glad I did not continue to order.Make sure you make reservations in advance on opentable or plan to wait about 1.5-2hrs.Come to Miku for the experience of seared sushi and walk around the waterfront area. Do not order Kagoshima Wagu and hopefully it was just an off night for me.What you need to know: - Parking lots are available - Easily accesible via metro - Cabs are abundant in the area",2/10/2015,3 star rating
487,Denise W.,"Surrey, BC","I love this sushi place. When I was working downtown near coal harbour. I used to go there a lot. Again that time they were located in Coal Harbour. After they have moved, they changed their menu completely. Aburi, Aburi and Aburi. Lots of Aburi sushi. This is truly a sushi place. If you are thinking of donburi then this is not a great place to go. I do love the food here and I have to agree they have very high quality Aburi. Their decor does remind me of their old location. Very clean and spacious. Yes it is bigger then their old location. With their service. I have to give them a 5 star on it. We got a friendly server and he was good at recommending what is good. I will give them thumbs up and 5 stars. Definitely will be coming back.",8/16/2015,5 star rating

490,Amy T.,"Vancouver, BC","If you're visiting Vancouver or just want to treat yourself, do not miss Miku.  Besides a beautiful view of the water and Convention Centre, it will be one of the better places in the city to indulge in Japanese food.For lunch, we ordered a few things such as the Premium Zen, which was $42 and contained the following:-Miku Zen - premium dishes from kitchen, raw bar, miso soup.  A quick sample of some Miku items.  Everything was of course delicious.-Sashimi Salad - light and refreshing-Fresh Oyster & Tiger Prawn Cocktail - love raw oysters, but I didn't particularly like the sauce, it was a wasabi chimichurri-Sous Vide Chicken Breast with kale goma-ae, pickled cucumber and sesame ponzu.  Juicy and tender chicken.  Kale goma-ae was really interesting and I enjoyed it.-Baked Sablefish - Always good, but even better at Miku.-Aburi Sushi - contained 8 pieces - fresh fresh fresh.-Ebi Oshi Sushi - pressed prawn sushi - This was surprisingly my favorite roll, the prawns with a bit of lime zest on top and ume sauce really balanced everything.-Miku Roll - salmon, crab, uni, cucumber, rolled in tobiko pressed sushi - Delicious and we ordered another Miku Roll afterwards.-Red Wave Roll - crab, avocado, red tuna pressed sushi - Another pressed sushi and Miku's signature style.-Green Tea Opera Cake - dessert and so delectably good.Appetizer dish - Chicken Nanban $13 - sweet and sour soy, battered and fried chicken pieces served with tartar sauce and basil-citrus slaw.  I don't go to Japanese restaurants to order fried chicken, but this dish blew everyone's minds.  My husband was delighted at how light and juicy the chicken tasted.  I couldn't stop eating the chicken and that amazing slaw.  My daughter, who is a super picky eater, asked me to order another round of chicken.Entree - Miso Baked Sablefish $35 - served with quinoa salad and vegetables.  Another 5 star dish and all of us gobbled it all up.If you plan on visiting, I'd get the Premium Zen again just to be able to taste all their specialty items.  If you have more people to share, add the Chicken Nanban and Baked Sablefish.  No regrets.",6/30/2017,5 star rating

Calamari appy has a nice crisp and season beautifully. Next the Aburi Prime (omakase), a nice ensemble of nigiri sushi. Miku's popular Salmon Aburi was a recommended, call me crazy, but although it is wildly popular, I tasted more of the Miku sauce than salmon itself....sorry, wasn't a fan. We also had the Miku roll and Red Wave roll, those were excellent. To polish things off, I had the 10oz. Prime Rib. Yum!!! Forgot to add, the service was fantastic. Flooded with attention. My only critique is, when the server breezed through the description of each sushi from the omakase as if it was a race.",9/13/2018,4 star rating

496,Leslie P.,"Torrance, United States","We came after our friends recommended this place. This wanted the chirashi bowl, but that was only served during lunch. Instead, we ordered sashimi with a side of rice. The sashimi was $20 per person or 7 pieces. It was super fresh and sweet. It even came with ebi which were smooth & sweet. I sucked on the shrimp head and it was quite tasty! I thought it was less potent than cooked shrimp head. Per the waitress' suggestion, we ordered the ebi fritters. This was battered & fried prawns (5 pieces). This was just okay. The shrimp was cooked well, but the batter was too thick. I peeled off most of the batter because it was just too much. The sauces were good though. Another plus is the customer service / attentiveness when my friend mentioned she was severely allergic to nuts. The manager came out and explained that her dish that she wanted to order did not have nuts, and that to stay away from the desserts. He guaranteed her entree would not be cross contaminated with nuts whatsoever.",7/17/2015,4 star rating

The drink menu was also impressive, and we had a few different selections from their cocktail list - notably, the Nightshade and Import Ash were absolutely excellent.Service was outstanding, and our server (bartender) was extremely helpful in both food & drink recommendations.

505,Garima C.,"Vancouver, BC","Oh I would dream and talk about that Aburi Oshi Sushi for a long time!It was our first time visiting this place , we got ebi fritters for starter and all the three types of aburi oshi sushi.The ebi fritters were these giant perfectly fried tender prawns. They were just perfect! As soon as I put the sushi in my mouth it was like a revelation, it was one of those moments when your life change, when you know that you have just had the best sushi in your life. It just melted away in the mouth, I wanted to savor every moment.Both the salmon oshi and ebi oshi were amazing, the saba oshi was also good but compared to the other two it fell a little short. Though it looked like we didn't have a lot of food but by the end of our sushi meal both me and my husband felt really full, maybe because the rice is pressed so you don't realize how much you ate or it expands or we were so satisfied with the food but we felt really full after this meal. It might be little costly but its so worth it and you definitely splurge once in a while on something so good.Can't wait to go back.",6/15/2018,5 star rating

We also got the Brussels sprout chips which were pretty well made albeit a bit on the tangy side. We ordered two sushi's - the salmon oshi sushi and the red wave roll. But we're tasty and unique but didn't have the wow factor I was hoping for. Nevertheless I would definitely come back and try some new things.

The facility, view, and service are all fantastic and the selection of alcohol (both domestic and Japanese) is superb. Unfortunately, at the risk of sounding like a sushi snob, I can say with confidence that the dishes here are a far cry from the divine experience proper sushi joints can offer. I had never heard of Aburi style sushi before but the practice of grilling half of the fish seems completely asinine to me.With that being said, Miku is very affordable so the overall value proposition is not that bad.

513,Annette T.,"San Jose, United States","I went here for a birthday dinner while I was playing tourist in Vancouver B.C. This place had gotten remarkable Yelp reviews and I had heard that Asian food was the cuisine to try while visiting. The restaurant itself overlooks the pier at Canada Place and has a ""bring your date here"" vibe since the lights are dimly lit and the tables are within the vicinity to one another. We had ordered the following:-Oyster Shooter: A tasty shot of oyster mixed with seaweed, ponzu, and yuzu.-Ebi Fritter: White tiger prawns in a herb beer batter served with some greens. I usually don't like prawns but this dish was unbelievably good. -American Waygu Beef Nigiri: So so good! The waygu is flame-seared with signature sauces (or they like to call it ""aburi"") with a hint of wasabi sitting on top of a rice sliver. -Salmon Oshi Sushi: By far their most popular dish using the aburi technique (pressed B.C. Sockeye Salmon, jalapeño, and Miku sauce). To me it tasted mediocre.-Miku Roll: We ordered half of this roll (which had salmon, crab, uni, cucumber rolled in tobiko with their Miku sauce) along the other half from the Red Wave roll. The Red Wave roll tasted much better than the Miku roll. It was basically a CA roll with sweet onions on top.-Green Tea Opera Cake: Pretty tasty but a somewhat small portion. There were ""filler"" decorations that were edible that I could've done without. Only reason I docked a star was our server/whole restaurant was understaffed and service was slow/inattentive. I noticed that was true of all the restaurants I went to while in Vancouver. However, if I ever come back to visit, I'd definitely eat here again.",11/21/2016,4 star rating

I got some combo sushi lunch and my wife got a couple rolls, we also got some sashimi. All the flavors are simply amazing. We love all sushi and are not super picky, but the quality here is above almost nothing else we have had.

I had a front row seat to the torch prep and sushi chefs at work. Also noticed they do take out though not advertised, you have to call the host to place the order for pickup and it's a limited menu. The oshi is included on it and the waitstaff told me I could do a one and half order too. I loved what I had so much I may just do that as I'm staying near by. Must try if you are in the area.

521,Kin H.,"San Jose, United States","It was our first visit to Vancouver, and we had high expectations for Miku.  From a presentation and service standpoint, they were top notch. We were seated on the patio facing the water and it was a fantastic view.  Ordered some wine to wet the palette followed by a few bottles of sake. For appetizers, we ordered the beef carpaccio, followed by the large seafood platter, and a seared lobster entree.   The beef carpaccio was nice, lots of flavor, and a good start to the meal.  So far so good. The seafood platter unfortunately did not live up to our expectations .   The shellfish were bland, almost seemed liked they were blanched with water.   (I'm sure it wasn't but it tasted like it).  The sashimi however was hit or miss.  The tuna, and the white fish were fantastic and fresh.   Oddly enough the salmon wasn't as great.  Our final dish, the lobster entree was fantastic.  Lightly seared on the surface, and full of flavor when you bite in.   I possibly would have rated Miku higher if I didn't go in with 5star expectations.   I would definitely try Miku again.  Perhaps I went On an off night..  but that night, I felt like we went to see a good show with an ending that just leaves you feeling lacking.",9/20/2017,3 star rating
522,Hera M.,"Sartell, United States","Excellent sushi, so good that you don't need soy sauce. This is the only sushi place ever that discourages soy sauce use for their sushi rolls because they each have their own type of sauce in it. We had the Salmon Oshi , Ebi Oshi, Miku, and King rolls. For appetizer, we ordered the Tiger Prawns. It was all delicious. Their house recipe mocktails were very good too for those that don't drink. My favorite is the Salmon Oshi, I love the way it's perfectly rectangular pieces with one thin slice of jalapeño on it. Fish is all fresh and the rice they use is so good and tasty. For a place that's waterfront, it has amazing food. I'm so glad they don't rely on the view alone. Locals love this place too. Their food is the hero here.",7/3/2017,5 star rating

524,Dani B.,"Miller Place, United States","I have to say, everything about this place is fantastic. From the moment we stepped inside until we left, it felt absolutely magical. Everyone was so friendly, the food was divine, and the ambience was perfect. Relaxing, clean, airy. Thomas was one of the best servers I've ever met in my life - very knowledgable, friendly, and he even knew about Jiro Dreams of Sushi, a documentary I love and we talked about Sushi Nakazawa in Manhattan. He also recommended some other places to try during our (unfortunately) short stay in Vancouver.After Thomas explained the menu to us and we ordered some nigori sake (and he made sure to get new glasses that were freshly polished), I chose the miku signature selection and a piece of uni sushi. It was incredible. Everything was so perfectly balanced. A perfect amount of wasabi on the uni and the specialty sauces complimented each of the nigiri pieces so well (no soy sauce needed). The rice was seasoned with vinegar perfectly. I cannot say more about how excellent the sushi was. I typically have traditional pieces of nigirizushi but the aburi and pressed styles were just fantastic. Although they didn't have any tamago, I finished with a perfectly delicate piece of tobiko sushi. We had to get dessert - the selection was too unique to pass up. I loved the inspiration, the merging of Japanese and European cuisine influences. We had a passion fruit infused apple tart dessert. It looked and tasted absolutely beautiful.At the end of the meal we had a bit of shuffling to do with the bill for company reimbursement purposes and Thomas was super understanding. I always feel like a pain asking for servers to separate  checks and separate alcohol from food bills but he even offered to separate each between the two of us and even split the sake. So incredibly helpful. The service was really outstanding. We were seated by the window and watched the rain come down outside as we sat cozy by the candlelight. The high ceilings are refreshing. The sushi and sake and dessert, even more so. Although a local told me this place is a tourist trap with high prices and better sushi places around, I don't regret going for even a second. Worth it. Overall, I absolutely loved everything and had a wonderful experience at this place.

Yeah well if I don't then move on because Miku is worth turning off your cell phone, putting the dog in the yard, getting a dog/baby-sitter and unplugging all major appliances - so listen the EF up!Miku is my jam, my YVR pals spoke highly of them and said that if I had to have one meal it would be here. So let's begin by thanking my gal pal Jody for listing this as a must try spot in Vancouver.I walked in with about 45 minutes left in their lunch service, was seated right away and attended to within seconds. My server was fantastic, despite my later arrival he was patient, informative and never made me feel rushed throughout the process - ensuring to explain the menu, his recommendations and how best to enjoy their sushi (without soy sauce - pro tip).Miku is famous for their pressed/torched sushi and most famous for their layered pressed salmon sushi with rice, special mayo and jalapeno. It's an entré option on its own and I wish I would have gotten that because once I tried it in my meal I was in love.For my meal I wanted to experience all they offered in their famous pressed/sushi menu as well as taste the freshness of their sashimi. To accomplish this I had the premium sushi platter which came with a chef's selection of their famous pressed sushi including the aforementioned salmon, fresh mackerel, an assortment of other pressed options and some fun spins on traditional sushi. Every bite on this plate was absolutely fantastic and had cost and time not been a factor I might have ordered 1-2 more platters of this.To try their fish I went with their sashimi platter which was un-believ-a-bull! So fresh, but also so few pieces - 8 only! Knowing I had only limited quantities of this fresh fish (from Japan every couple of days) I ensured to heed my servers advice and take my time and savour every piece of fish, chewing slowly and wow. Kiku has opened my mind and expanded my palate to truly realize what REAL sushi is! Thank you for that! They apparently have a location now on Bay Street in Toronto - so long bank account!Eatcrest out",9/5/2016,5 star rating
528,Ninja M.,"Edmonton, AB","Beautiful view, great service and fresh,fresh fish.  Apparently #8 sushi restaurant in the world.  Not sure by whom to be fair but we were blown away by dinner.  We ordered Kaisen Kaiseki dinner (set by the chef).  6 courses in all including an in house made dessert and green tea ice cream.   The kaiseki includes nigiri sushi, sashimi, lobster tail and  raw oyster.   Too many courses to name.  Presentation is beautiful w specially made plates that complement the meal.   Make reservations to avoid waiting for a loooong time.  This is busy w locals and tourists alike.   It's location beside the convention centre makes it ideal for conference attendees.",4/1/2018,5 star rating

531,Dessi V.,"Verdun, QC","Woke up at 4:30 am ET, got on a plane, landed somewhere in the West Coast and drove to Vancouver for 3 hours. After long day I was finally seated at 7:30 pm PT on the beautiful patio of Miku overlooking Canada Place, the harbour and surrounding mountains. The food choice was simple, two sushi rolls and five sashimis, 6 pieces each. What happened with the first round of sashimi was magic, suddenly my taste buds were awake, my energy was back.  The albacore belly, scallops, sockeye salmon were amazing, as well as the miku roll enveloped in fish roe. The dinner was rounded up with wonderful cherry cassis dessert.   Service was great, from the bar tenders who fixed our cocktails while we were waiting for the table to our hostess, everybody was very attentive. The drinks menu has so many sakes that a non connoisseur as me can get easily lost. We ended up with a recommendation from the staff for drinks in general, including my delicious Wind 24 concoction of sake and cantaloupe infused gin.  Great experince!

532,Teranze L.,"San Francisco, United States","TLDR: This place is amazing. Everything about it was great. The ambiance, the service, the food, you name it. Ordering off the menu can be a very intimidating experience, but our server did a great job explaining every little nuance about it and even gave us some of his personal recommendations. Our server even came up to us and asked us to see if my girlfriend's drink needed to be topped off with more citrus foam! (The cocktail she ordered had a delicious foam that kept dissolving). He did a great job in making sure were well taken care of. At the end of our meal, he knew we were visiting from out of town and have us more personal recommendations on where we should go eat. (I wish I remembered his name! We would go back just because of the experience he gave us! It was an Asian gentleman wearing wrist guard) To sum it up, the service and staff are A1 in my book.For the food, we had a set menu tasting off their Sakura festival menu. Nigiri was fresh and the other food included was great. Would recommend this place to people who want to have a nice dinner in Vancouver. Btw the price is definitely three dollar signs. We came here for a special occasion and it was worth it.",4/4/2018,5 star rating
533,Heather T.,"Vancouver, BC","I'd consider this place a little higher end in comparison to the places I'd usually dine out at. Anything that pressures me to be relatively proper makes me incredibly nervous. Nonetheless, the food and service here go hand in hand. My date and I ordered calamari, aburi beef carpaccio, the sunset roll and salmon oshi sushi. Calamari was lovely, not too greasy and crispy like it's supposed to be. Sunset roll was meh. Lemme cut to the chase. I could rave on and on about the carpaccio and the salmon oshi sushi. Ouuuweee. The salmon just melts in your mouth. It's amazing. 10/10 recommend! Shout out to my date for having great taste.",3/21/2018,5 star rating

535,Harry A.,"Toronto, ON","went in late on a Sunday evening without reservations, but were still able to get a table by the exit.  Not a great table but grateful we got one, period!  We ordered individual sushi, some white wine and sake.  Service was okay to very good, depending on the fish/sushi.  Toro was good, uni was great but the salmon and hamachi were ok. Overall, I would give the food 7/10.  The service however, wow, for a restaurant that charges this much, you would think the service would be much better.  No one there from the hostess at the front was very welcoming nor friendly.  No smiles.  Our server was nice enough.  However, but could not recommend a wine that we were looking for (we asked for anything dry/not sweet) as we were not family with Okanagan wine).  Anyway the wine they recommended and brought was sweet as a desert wine.  After almost finishing the meal, we wanted to have a few more pieces of sushi/sashimi and asked for a menu.  After receiving the menus, we weren't able to get the server to come back for 20 minutes. By then, we didn't feel like eating any more.  When she asked (didn't get the name of the lady) if we wanted to order something more, I mentioned nicely, that it's ok, because we'd been looking for her for 20 minutes  and now no one feels like eating more.  She got all pouty and just left.  After which, she never came back.  She had asked a male colleague to come serve us.  He filled out waters (for the first time that night) and then when the bill came, he brought it to us.  She was no where to be seen!!!!   My message to the server if you happen to ever see this review, if a customers nicely points out that you were missing for 20 minutes, an apology (sincere or not) would be the right first course of action.  Be a pro.  No apology, just pouting and disappearance.  Unbelievable.  We tipped 10% but boy, did we feel like that was even too much!!!! that was more for the bus people and kitchen staff!  High end restaurant but low end service and staff! Ruined the experience and meal!!!!!",8/8/2019,2 star rating
536,Denise W.,"Toronto, ON","The food is good but I still think this place is slightly over hyped. It isn't the only place that does aburi well (hello Kishimoto!) The extra half star is really for the ambience, views and the service. I tried their sable fish for the first time this time and it was pretty good. Their Kaiso seaweed salad was delicous. And I do really appreciate the fact that they have so many gluten free items on the menu. This gets major plus points from me.The server also asked me for my ID (he too, was Asian?! His radar was so off!!) so that also made my day - more extra points. We didn't leave until almost closing and there were still quite a few people around the bar. I liked how lively it was. Next time will definitely come back and try dining at the bar.",11/23/2016,4 star rating
537,Sarah N.,"Richardson, United States","Holy sushi batman!  Miku totally lived up to all the hype.  The sushi was super fresh, artistically presented, and above all, super tasty.   The lobster tail, too, was very good.  I would say, since seafood is their thing, stick with that.  I got the steak once and it was pretty bland and meh.  Remember to make a reservation a few days ahead of time because this place runs out of room quickly.  But it's totally worth the wait!  If you get a table with a view of the water, score for you!  Overall, this is probably the best restaurant I've been to in Vancouver.",6/9/2017,5 star rating
538,Kirsten S.,"Las Vegas, United States","Wow, I am so glad that my acupuncturist recommended this restaurant to me!  I was in Vancouver for one day after my cruise and came here for lunch.  It was Friday and really busy, I waited for about 15 minutes for a seat at the bar but it was worth it.  When I sat down there was a Premium Zen menu that had multiple courses for $42 so I went with that.  The bartender helped me find a great local beer, Philip's Blue Buck, that went great with all the dishes.  The courses came out quickly but not so quickly I didn't have time to savor everything.I really enjoyed the set menu because it had things on it I would not have ordered by myself but still enjoyed every delicious bite of it.  Each course was a presentation unto itself with the dessert being a work of art I almost didn't want to ruin, but I did. If I find myself back in Vancouver I will be eating at Miku again and I shall recommend it to all my friends. Review also on Trip Advisor.",5/20/2017,5 star rating

540,Christine H.,"San Francisco, United States","Perfectly squared sushi! This place was so bomb. I wish it was closer to home.  I definitely recommend making a reservation. I made a reservation before my trip and it was very easy online. I recommend booking a month before your trip. Everything on the menu was delicious. Starting with the appetizer to the dessert every thing was so good. I can't empathize how tasty everything was. For appetizer I ordered beef carpaccio. It was very light and mouth watering. The presentation of it was absolutely stunning. The best part of the meal were the sushi. I ordered the salmon oshi, ebi oshi, and saba oshi sushi. These are the perfectly squared sushi. These were absolutely delicious. I want some as I write this. lol. By preference I enjoy the sushi in that order. So if you had to pick one to try I recommend getting the salmon oshi. I believe I also ordered the miku roll and red wave roll and that is as tasty as their aburi. To top of a very enjoyable night of delicious Japanese food, I recommend the green tea opera. I enjoyed the presentation and it easy very yummy. Overall, when I come back to Vancouver I will definitely stop by here again. The presentation and ambiance was very enjoyable.",8/20/2017,5 star rating
541,Faith D.,"Charlotte, United States","Believe the hype. It is all true - no Russia involved fake news here! Stop reading & make your reservation now before it's gone and then come back to this review to know what you signed up for.My boss recommended this restaurant based on her visit over a year ago. I remember her describing this place as one of the best sushi she has ever eaten. Bookmarked then and the moment I confirmed my Vancouver trip, I reserved my spot.At first I was skeptical walking to its location since it is across the cruise port. My assumption of many places next to a port is that they are touristy and maybe not as high on quality. Well, I was completely wrong - Miku is top notch and 1of 8 best sushi places (according to their menu, I can't remember who rated them).The presentation was beautiful and artistically displayed! My friend and I ordered the premium sushi lunch of 12 pieces. Each piece was delicious! I left completely satisfied and full, but wanting more, yet thankful it was just right. The sushi melted in my mouth - no soy sauce needed; that would be insulting to the perfection of each piece.Our server nailed being friendly, warm, and professional. He was attentive at just the right times, yet left us to be lost in good conversation.My words cannot describe how great our experience was. I'm sure other Yelpers capture this so much better.

542,Ron M.,"Renton, United States","When you think of Vancouver, you think of cool places and excellent sushi. This place delivers on both with an amazing atmosphere, a phenomenally clean kitchen filled with Asian guys instead of non-Asians like you often see in other places. These guys are well managed and have their art down to a science, so it's a blast to sit at the sushi bar and watch them work.This is really rich for sushi so if you are one to have a stomach that can't handle rich buttery foods then be careful here as it's not a pure Japanese place. It's more of a fancy fusion style restaurant. They have good sake list too - which is hard to find these days.With that said, it was an excellent date night and a lot of fun. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in Vancouver.",9/15/2016,5 star rating

544,Chad H.,"San Diego, United States","Miku, located in downtown Vancouver, is a hip, open decor restaurant that has a solid menu and extensive sake list. Their open concept kitchen was a joy to watch as at least twenty chefs danced around making their creative morsels.  Service was very friendly and patient. We were parched from flying all day and our water was filled no less than five times.  The food, as the other 598 yelpers have already raved about, is 5 stars without a doubt.  What threw us for a loop was that the creativity didn't end with the main meal, but extended to the deserts.  Ingredients such as goose berries and rhubarb sealed the deal. Why four stars and not five, it was way too loud.  They owners need to seriously rethink the design and add some type of sound deadening material to drop the decibels a few notches without  compromise the ambiance.",7/17/2016,4 star rating

552,Vivian C.,"San Francisco, United States","Miku was the first place in Vancouver to offer aburi sushi and it used to be flawless- melted in your mouth , balanced flavours and perfectly made rice.Unfortunately the last two visits has confirmed the end of their reign on top quality aburi . The rice was too sweet, the ratio of fish to rice was off ( way too much rice ) and no melting sensation .  The eggplant aburi use to melt now it's chewy . Restaurants like black rice have caught up in terms of quality , imagination at a lower price. At Miku ,the food has a mass produced feel and for what you pay , it's not worth it. Very sad as this was my favourite place for Japanese .",5/16/2018,2 star rating
553,Darrin J.,"San Jose, United States","Maybe my expectations we too high given the 4.5 stars on Yelp but unfortunately I left disappointed. Starting with their insistence at sitting at the sushi bar even though there were plenty of empty tables during lunch time by they time I left. Miso marinated sablefish was just average with good flavor but texture of fish was a but mushy instead of flaky.  Unagi was so charbroiled the sweetness of the meat is lost to burnt taste. The ""pressed"" Salmon Oshi Sushi lacked flavor except the jalapeno and the dense texture reminded my of the texture of spam.  Their overall selection of sushi was very limited and they refused any special requests (e.g. Unagi roll).  Really not what I would have expected for a 4.5 star place.",5/13/2018,3 star rating

559,Brandon M.,"Toronto, ON","We went to Miku for lunch on Tuesday. We were seated windowside which was very nice! Great view of the harbour from the restaurant (though it is mostly blocked off by the big Canada Place building). We were craving mostly sushi so we ordered the premium (12pc), basic (10pc), and aburi oshi (half & half). We've tried a lot of great sushi joints including top tier omakase and while Miku is not up there, the quality was pretty good. Salmon oshi was a flavour bomb and definitely preferable over ebi. The reason I'm giving four stars is because the food wasn't all that memorable, wasn't excessively better than good sushi places at lower price point, and the dessert Green Tea Opera was lackluster for the price of $14. Food itself would be 3.5 for me but the nice view, well decorated spot, and friendly staff bumped it up to four for me.I would try out Miku in Toronto just to compare to its Vancouver counterpart.",9/5/2018,4 star rating

The servers are all very professional and service is quick.What I got:- Half order of each of the 3 aburi style sushi: the ebi was my favourite as it was more ""fatty"" tasting and very rich on the tongue! These were very flavorful but did not blow my mind as I was expecting. - Sashimi consisting of salmon, scallop, and tuna: very fresh and tasty. - Green opera dessert: beautiful presentation and lovely mix of textures and fruity flavors. I was impressed by this dessert! Overall, it was a yummy meal but quite expensive; the above costed about $75 and I was not completely full.

572,Lexi W.,"Sunnyvale, United States","Let me be explicit with the two star rating. I'm visiting Vancouver and Canada for the first time. Saw Miku on some recommended restaurants lists so I made a reservation for lunch. The food at Miku was worth a five star rating. I had the lunch Shokai. There were a variety of hints such as yuzu and jalapeno added in sushi and made it very flavorful. The waitress serving my table was good as well. The cocktail she recommended was amazing and I ordered a second one. There were four or five receptionists with Instagram looks and trendy outfits. Unfortunately none of them were polite. No greeting no smiles when I walked in. They just glanced at me until I said that I have a reservation. Not even a glance or a word when I walked out. I have to say I was a bit shocked as I always heard that Canadian and Japanese are the most polite people in the world. Apparently that's not the case at this Japanese restaurant in Canada... I believe Miku is on many lists of recommended places to go in Vancouver for visitors. To some extend, Miku is representing not only itself but also Vancouver the city. I hope the restaurant can recruit and train their receptionists with the right standard of upscale Japanese restaurants instead of the standard of amateur Instagram influencers.",10/13/2019,2 star rating

577,Kathy C.,"Jacksonville, United States","I am a fan of Miku.  I made a reservation for a late dinner as our last meal for the recent Vancouver trip.  I am glad I did.  Amongst all the great restaurants in Vancouver, I wanted a place that we can enjoy a good meal with great service, and a view of Vancouver night lights.  Upon walking in, I was disappointed that we were sat by a very large and loud party.  It was not the restaurant's fault that this large group was having so much fun and probably had a few too many to drink, but it was difficult to even hear what our server is saying to us.  Finally, we asked if it's possible to move our table.  The hostess immediately came and apologized, took us to another table, which means we have a new server as well.  However, what impressed me was, afterwards, while we were having our meal, our first server even came to check up on us, making sure we are doing alright.  This is going above and beyond your normal service and we really appreciated that.We tried a few different dishes.  Of course, their signature Aburi Oshi Sushi are a must, so we ordered both salmon and ebi.  We also tried the Japanese Wagyu beef nigiri and a plate of hamachi sashimi.  Hearing their scallop special for the night, I had to order that as well.  Lastly we also shared the Green Tea Opera as dessert.  Everything was delicious.  The salmon oshi did not disappoint and was my favorite of the night.  I can see us returning just to have an order or two of the Salmon Oshi Sushi and a drink and enjoy the gorgeous view the next time we visit Vancouver.",12/8/2017,4 star rating
578,Janice B.,"Bellevue, United States","I was so excited based on all the reviews on yelp, but it was a very disappointing experience. I believe this place is for the people who does not really know about sushi, who only is able to enjoy candied sushi. *The sushi is flavorless and super overpriced for what it is.* For some reason, the sushi we got was bombarded wasabi (literally too much) so we had to take them out. I am one of the people who likes wasabi but that was way too much. There are tons of other sushi restaurants in Vancouver that offers better sushi in better price. The service was also really bad. The guy working at the bar was avoiding eye contact, obviously didn't care, never checked on us, but stayed the whole time to check on how much we would tip him. The waiters here(non-asians) act like they know so much about sushi, giving information about what we already know, which was funny cuz they are working at a place that doesn't offer the good sushi. The ambiance was huge and modern, which probably is why this place attracts customers. Miku seemed like it is all about the ambiance, actually.I felt so bad for giving up one dinner experience here during my short trip, when I could have went to other better restaurants.",11/26/2017,1 star rating

580,Heali T.,"Vancouver, BC","Try the Miku zen at lunch, and you will thank me. It is essentially a bento box foodgasm.First they drop off the miso soup, but then before you know it, you are knees deep in Miku Zen delight:The wooden box arrives with four mini dishes: an edamame and quinoa salad topped with shrimp, seared tuna in yuzu, the drool-worthy giant prawn fritter topped in some kind of tangy aioli, and lastly the ooey-gooey beef short ribs that literally Melt. In. Your. Mouth. Like, rib-sticking good.Right when you think it couldn't get any better, BOOM! They drop off 5 pieces of their best sushi. First there is some kind of tuna, next ebi topped with a herbed pesto butter (Yum), some sort of real crab roll, and 2 of my favorite, the pressed salmon rolls that made them famous. I can say the sushi is hands-down the best quality I have tried in Vancouver. The room is beautiful, and location is smack in the middle of the CBD.So ya, if you've heard its expensive, you know why. Just trust me and go in for the Miku Zen, you can thank me later ;)",7/7/2016,5 star rating
581,Jenn N.,"Calgary, AB","What a way to end a trip to Van, lunch at a restaurant with a beautiful view of the bay and amazing food.We decided to go miku zen (selection of chef chosen items and pieces of their famous Aburi sushi) so we could experience everything Miku had to offer. Our items were: ebi fritter, quinoa salad, beef shank & potato and seared tuna. We also got a order of the chicken nanban (it was like a fancy japanese style chicken nuggets!)Everything was sensational! You could tell the chefs put a lot of effort into each dish, the textures and flavors of everything were perfectly brought together. If you've never had aburi style, you're missing out. The flame searing gives the fish a wonderful smoky and caramelized touch.Well worth the price and it'll be an experience you won't forget!",1/11/2017,5 star rating

Not to mention the amazing tea and chocolate treats.The food: I came in on mothersday so I did the mothersday Zen miku. It was delicious, the sushi was masterfully crafted. Their sushi tastes so much better than other places because they char the top pieces and use a delicate balance of sauces to create the perfect bite. The oyster was also delicious. The green genmaicha  tea was also amazing. Also, at the door they have these super cute mint chocolates, such a cute touch imo. The ambiance: breathtaking view and Trendy decor. Nuff said.The service: my cup was never dry. Our waiters were truly exceptional. So attentive. 5/5 Overall, terrific place.

586,Phuong L.,"Burlingame, United States","Ok you guys I hate to say it..... SERVICE SUCKS. My party of three arrived at 7:30 on a Sunday night for a birthday celebration. The service was inattentive and impersonal to say the least. I had mentioned in the reservation that one of the patrons was a vegetarian. I was so excited to try the Aburi course menu, but was informed that since one of the guest was vegetarian I couldn't order it. Apparently the whole table has to order it. Ok... I guess. Waitress mentioned that she would have to ask the chef to accommodate the one person order of Aburi Kaeseki, she NEVER DID LOL. NOPE. She Instead informs me that I must be confused because since I'm already ordering seared fish I should just be fine with that order and not get the ABURI special because it was going to be ""$150 for one person portion "" LOL LMAO. She repeatedly mentioned  the price. I get it SIS its $150, that's kind of on the cheap end of Omakase but weird flex I guess. I then asked her about the uni special. Conversation went like this: ME: is your uni  local or from Japan? *crickets* waitress ignores my question, so I ask again.   ""is your uni  local or from Japan? "". Waitress responds ""it comes in a spoon, and it's $15 per spoon"". Okkkk... here comes the price quotes again, but that wasn't the question. Overall the food was fine. The toro tuna wasn't as rich and fatty as it should've been, and the rice was too wet and nowhere near the right acidity, but what do I know. I'm John snow, I know nothing except that the KAESEKI ABURI is $150 dollars per person and that uni comes in a spoon.  Thank you waitress with brown hair with the most condescending tone and patronizing smile.

You probably won't spend $80/person, unless you are drinking, but you won't be underwhelmed. We were in town two nights and we came here for dinner and then late night snack the next. They have traditional seating, restaurant seating and bar seating. The drink list was impressive as well for a sushi place. They have some interesting dishes and traditional dishes and everything was well prepared, presented perfectly and tasted divine. I can't remember everything we got but my favorite were these rice square things that were a perfect bite size. I hate it when rolls are too big for your mouth or are uncomfortable to eat. I attached a picture. There were three options and they were all so good. On your way out grab a handful of the mints that they give. Not just one, seriously grab a handful.

589,Becky C.,"Richmond, BC","We've heard great things about Miku and decided to try it out on Friday night.  We didn't make reservations, but was able to get seated right away since we were quite early (5:30pm). Food: Oyster Shooters: It was quite delicious, although the flavours were a bit salty for me.  Overall the mix of the flavours blended well and I definitely would have another one. Aburi Beef Carpaccio: Great! It came with an egg that went perfectly with the beef.  We also loved how beautiful it was displayed Hokkaido Scallop Trio: I absolutely love scallops, so we had to try this.  It was three scallops, each with a unique flavouring.  It was nicely displayed in a cast iron pan that was filled with boar bacon and brussel sprouts.  The brussel sprouts and boar bacon were very flavourful, a little oily, but delicious, The scallops had a hint of different flavours, but it didn't amaze me. Salmon Oshi Sushi & Ebi Ossi Sushi: We were told that this was a must have at Miku and I absolutely agree.  Although the salmon oshi sushi is a fan favourite, I personally felt that the ebi was more of my liking.  It tasted like butter melting in your mouth.  If you come to Miku, I would say that this is the must have item as I have never tasted anything like this anywhere else. Finally, we had the Green Tea Opera Cake: Although it was good, it wasn't the best thing I have ever tasted.  Service: It started off great, the server was odd but attentive and even allowed my hubby to try samples of the sake before ordering.  Although my hubby realized he didn't like the sake and ordered a flight of plum wine instead... but as the restaurant got busier, the service declined.  No one ever really came to check on us, and I had to wave down a server to get more water.  When the scallops arrived, no one told me the cast iron would be scorching hot and I also burnt my finger because I accidentally touched the handle while eating.  I felt like there was qualities of greatness, but it really depends on who you have serving you.  Price: I would say for the quality of food, it is decently priced. Based on the service we got, I had to deduct a star, but I will definitely come back.  I've heard great things about their lunch menu and I would love to try it out.",7/24/2016,4 star rating
590,David W.,"Los Angeles, United States","This place is a delight. I was brought here by a friend for lunch on a weekday and you see many business people eating her. The ambience is modern and sleek with seating viewing the harbor. Plenty of light coming in. The servers are very tentative (kind of too tentative). They make sure your table is always clean. Even when I have some sushi residual remaining, they ask if they can take the plates.We started with the Ebi Fritters - they were okay, bland batter covering the cooked shrimp. They Cool Harbor Platter has some great oysters (2x2 types) and good clams but a little overpriced for the amount you get. I was surprised and amazed by the Aburi Chirashi Tart. When I expected a chriashi bowl, I got a tower shaped multi layered sushi. The flavors are complex and very good (a must get). And onto the best plate, the Salmon Oshi Sushi. I don't know if it is the salmon or the way they make it, but they are so flavorful and sweet. I could get multiple plates and be happy ($17 CAD per plate of 6 pieces, a steal if you are from the US). The Saba Oshi Sushi was okay, I prefer the Salmon any day. Overall, great place to try.

594,Andrea W.,"Alhambra, United States","I LOVE Miku sushi!Their best dishes by far are their chirashi tart and the salmon aburi sushi. They put so much special effort into making their sushi taste unique, so this is a must try sushi spot in Vancouver. Vancouver is famous for excellent sushi, but Miku takes the #1 spot in my books. Pricewise, its definitely pricier than the average sushi place but it is worth it. Their cooked dishes are mediocre, and the sea harbor platter are ""just okay"", so I say just order more Aburi sushi!Ambience is very modern, and you have an ocean view for a large portion of the restaurant. If you get seated outside, they even provide blankets to keep you warm. The bathrooms are very fancy and clean. Coming from Los Angeles, this sushi spot is better than most of the modern sushi spots in LA and is priced so well. A similar meal in LA would cost at least double. Dont forget to make reservations!

We also ordered the prime rib entree - the steak was cooked perfectly and it was fantastic. The real winners were the Aburi sushi, where the tops are torched.

(Even though the owners of the restaurant are Japanese themselves and live in Japan!)I just wanted to add that the service was absolutely impeccable.  The dishes came out in a orderly manner with time in between each ""course"" (appies, hot, cold, sushi etc) and the server was very attentive but not bothersome.  It was really nice to see a mix of different people working there as well!  (Our hostess was Korean and our waitress was Latvian)",6/10/2014,5 star rating

One of their Aburi style rolls, it tastes buttery bad decadent. The texture comes off as similar to a well cooked lobster tail. The Star is definitely the Sockeye Salmon on the roll. It is beautifully seared which increased the fresh flavor tenfold.Cocktails: also well thought out. Recommend their Coconut Cooler made from a fresh coconut purée. Beefeater gin. Fresh lemon. Fresh Basil.We also had local oysters, a Sunset Roll, a Red Wave roll, Mackerel Nigiri, and Unahi Nigiri.

Service was quite nice - the manager spent some time with us and kept us well supplied from our bottle of cremant which went with everything quite well.  The ambiance is very Pacific Northwest trendy with an Asian influence. Our sushi was very good. The Aburi style is still unique but I remember the sauces being more pronounced the last time we were there - now much more subtle. What really shone for me was the sashimi. That was some of the best I've ever had - we had scallop and hamachi. Both fantastic and hamachi was expertly cut. Would go back again and again for that. Also had two rolls which were solid and a delicious dessert.,12/9/2016,4 star rating
605,PennyandRusty P.,"Vancouver, BC","It was over two years ago that I first visited Miku Restaurant in downtown Vancouver. From that moment, I knew that I'd eventually be back but I had no idea it would take so long for a revisit.As Miku is located near Canada Place, this place gets pretty busy with both the tourists and the downtown set.We decided to order the Coal Harbour Platter ($32) along with the Miku Zen ($28) and added an extra miso soup ($3). It's a bit steep for miso soup as many Japanese restaurants will give it to you for free, but the food at Miku is of a high standard and I have to admit that the miso soup here is better than most of the free ones I've had. Similarly, tea for two people here came out to $6.The Miku Zen is a selection of four seasonal items served with five pieces of their signature aburi sushi. It's a good choice if you're looking to try a bunch of different items.The tender braised beef shank was served on top a smooth and creamy potato purée. Next to that was their ebi fritter - a large white tiger prawn that's beer battered and served with a sweet chili aioli and soy-balsamic reduction.I'm not sure if it's a coincidence, but the Miku Zen on this visit was pretty much the same as the one I had over two years ago. I'm not sure if it changes at all. The other items included on this visit was aburi sashimi and a salad of shrimp, edamame, and quinoa.The Coal Harbour Platter ($32) contained fresh oysters, mussels, clams, prawns, kaisen poke, scallop ceviche, and kale gomaae.This bowl of shellfish was really quite good... the mussels were super fresh and plump and the prawns were very meaty.I'm not much of a kale person so I could have taken or left the kale gomaae. Similarly, the ceviche wasn't very interesting.Service was a bit off on this day... we waited and waited for our aburi sushi to arrive but finally had to ask the server about it.The aburi sushi came with 2 pieces of their signature salmon oshi sushi and 3 other pieces of sushi.Oshi is basically pressed sushi (they use a mold) and they give the salmon a light torch (aburi) which, when paired with the Miku sauce, just melts in your mouth.Overall, the food is pretty good here... it's a bit on the expensive side but the seafood is quite fresh.",4/4/2017,4 star rating
606,Kathy P.,"San Diego, United States","This restaurant came highly recommended by a friend who used to live in Vancouver. Decided to give it a try since it was also highly reviewed and brought 6 other diners with me. Unfortunately, most were disappointed and upset that I convinced them to spend so much money for disappointing sushi. We all purchased the winter zen box. But to be fair, most of us have been to Japan and tried expensive omakases. CUSTOMER SERVICE- 5 STARSATMOSPHERE- 5 STARSNice view, nice restaurant. You can see the chefs cooking.CLEANLINESS- 5 STARSFOOD- 3 STARSStarted off strong with their hot dishes but as we moved on to the sushi portion, it was very disappointing. The aburi sushi which seemed to be the main selling point of this restaurant was okay. The fish wasn't warm or juicy as I hoped but room temperature and nothing special. It seemed all of their sushi dishes were made to be American fusion with different toppings like pesto which I personally didn't find to work well with the sushi. It felt like they were trying too hard to make it fancy and it just didn't work. PRICING- 2 STARSPricey, fancy restaurant.

612,Alison S.,"Vancouver, BC","Miku is one of my favourite restaurants and though it is expensive, every time I've been it's been worth every penny (or credit card statement).The food is always very consistent and, c'mon, they invented aburi.  There's a lot of copycats out now (and some are not bad), but I always got a special spot in my heart for the original.  You can go for the faves (salmon oshi, sablefish) but if you really want a treat go for the kaiseki set menu.  It will blow. Your. Mind.  Service has always been top-notch as well.  When making special reservations they reply to emails very quickly and courteously, and were happy to answer any picky questions that I had.  During the dinner service the server also makes you feel like you are top priority even though it's always really busy and I know that they have other tables that they are waiting on too.  But that's how good they are!The private room is great with good sound insulation from the rest of the restaurant (I got to eat in the private room once for a work event and even though the restaurant outside was busy and bustling we had no problem hearing the powerpoint presentation during our meal).Do go!  Take a taxi so you don't have to worry about parking (or take the skytrain, the entrance to the station is literally ten steps away).  Eat some sablefish and aburi and order the kaiseki so you can admire the artistic plating.  And bring a friend (doesn't have to be me).",2/21/2018,5 star rating

But while traveling to Vancouver I put it on my list of must do things. First the restaurant is beautiful, clean and modern, and right on the water. It was also packed on a Sunday night at 8pm. Fortunately we had a reservation. We were seated in the dining room in a large booth with a view of the water. Our server, Natalie, was fantastic. She explained the entire menu, gave recommendations and even accommodated my raw shellfish allergy. Best recommendation she had was the calamari. My bf loves it, I do not. But I decided to try a bite and I ended up eating half the plate. He said it was the best he had ever had and I was amazed how much I liked it. It's a must!For our main dishes we both got the Miku Signature Selection Sushi Plates, mine had no raw shellfish. I'll admit I'm still not on the sushi bandwagon - at no fault to the restaurant. I will say I enjoyed it, loved the variety, it was very fresh and I'm so glad I ordered it. My favorite was the Salmon Oshi Sushi. I also had the green tea opera for desert. It was delicious and probably the most unique dessert I've ever had. Don't expect a lot of sushi posts from me, but this was Definitely a great experience and meal.

We changed minds a couple of times about how we wanted to sit together and they were very patient with us. In the end, we sat at the bar and were able to watch the chefs do their magic.Eight of us ordered the season special ($50), three of us the Miku Zen ($29), and one of us the aburi chirashi tart ($22.) I myself had the Miku Zen, which came with four delicious appetizers and an assortment of rolls. Everything was delicious. I could not get enough!If you ever go to Miku, definitely order the salmon oshi sushi! The salmon melts in your mouth and leaves a sweet aftertaste reminiscent of freshly baked pound cake. All of us were elated, satisfied, and happier than we had ever been the past two weeks. Though we walked in afraid that our money was going to be drained, we walked out grateful that our money had been drained!",8/23/2017,5 star rating

626,Eric Y.,"New York, United States",It was a rainy and gloomy afternoon we were tired and exhausted driving from our Whistler ski vacation. We wanted to cap it off fabulously with Vancouver's finest sushi restaurant.  After doing some handy dandy research on yelp we decided to go to highly rated Miku.  After a short walk; We arrived at about 230pm for a late lunch.  Miku was very busy waiting time was 40-60 min.  Deflated by the long wait time we decided we no longer wanted to walk around and research what to eat.  We opted to preserve our calories and wait patiently....As we heard other being called to the dinning room we could hear each other belly grovel.   We patiently waited and finally got called to a table.  60 minutes later we sat and prepared our bellies for a feast we looked at other tables in awe.   We ordered and got the Miku Zen; which is a nice collection of assorted sushi and various seasonal dishes Miku is quite possibly one of the best sushi restaurant in the Western Hemisphere. The only complaint we have about this restaurant is that we kinda felt rushed.  Otherwise it was an epic sushi restaurant. Next time we are in Vancouver this is the first restaurant we will go going to. Miku delivers in many levels. What are you waiting for? Check this place out. You won't be disappointed.,1/9/2018,5 star rating

628,Nida K.,"London, United Kingdom","Miku was an awesome experience and restaurant is very spacious and beautiful and has a nice view of the harbor. A group of friends and I went during lunchtime and we pretty much all got the Miku Zen which includes all their top dishes. What does Miku do really well? Presentation. It's all so beautiful! We ordered an Aburi Chirashi Tart which was REALLY good and this came as an appetizer. Our Miku Zens took a while to come out, probably since we ordered so many of them. I was most excited to try the Aburi Salmon Oshi which didn't disappoint. All the smaller dishes sort of came in this bento box type of thing and i liked everything in there! Service was really accommodating which i really appreciated and overall my entire group left the restaurant unanimously agreeing we really liked our meal here.

629,Gabe F.,"Manhattan, United States","Service was excellent and food was too notch. Best food on the menu is the aburi oshi sets. In addition, I got to order the Miku zen, which is essentially the daily special set where they select a list of best Choice of the day. This is the best selection for those that are not sure what to order. They can do it for you!  They always ask you for food allergies just to make sure. Shows respect for the customers.

The cod was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the fresh wasabi added a nice kick.

Amazing use of the Aburi technique, that which you use a focused flame to caramelize elements of the rolls. Seriously beautiful restaurant, with some amazing views.

644,Steven K.,"Manhattan Beach, United States",We ate here twice as the views were beautiful and the sushi was actually really delicious.  Only reason for the three stars was some weirdness at the front desk when we checked in as they had us wait for 15 minutes even though the restaurant was empty.  No explanation given so made it uncomfortable.The sushi is also unique in that much of it is seared.  No soy sauce unless requested for most of the sushi items.  You should really try their assortments as they give you a good flavor of Miku.,4/8/2016,3 star rating

The presentation of the sushi was artful but when digging in, I was not over-all impressed by the taste. You could tell the fish was quality but upon arrival there were flies buzzing around inside and I noticed one of the chefs behind the counter touch the food with bare hands.We tried two beautiful desserts and were very pleased with the combination of flavors and the presentation!

649,Tony R.,"Mississauga, ON","View - 5, Service - 4, Food - 3, Value - 2, Visits - 1If you know a bit about Japanese food and it's a varied knowledge from AYCE to Tsukiji, them your opinion of Miku may be very much different than the numerous reviews that praise this place as the holy grail of Japanese food. With numerous awards and the Top Japanese Restaurant in Vancouver for 2015, and a visit to their website, you might think that this is Japanese bliss. And while dining at Miku is a pleasant experience, there are better places in Vancouver for Japanese food. They may just not have the same great view of Coal Harbour, the great interior design and unformed wait staff. For pure Japanese food quality and presentation, nothing beats Kishimoto on Commercial. However for a great ambiance and corporate or special occasion gathering it's hard to beat Miku. And it is equally hard for me not to give them a full 5 points.To begin with, they use an Aburi style of preparation which means the sushi is lightly seared with a torch flame and complimented with special sauces that do not require soy sauce. I started with the Aburi Sashimi Selection which has 2 pieces each of Sockeye Salmon, Maguro (Tuna), Hotate (Scallop) and Hamachi (Yellow Tail Tuna). It wasn't easy getting used to the Aburi style when you are so deeply established on the standard preparation of sushi which is basically the same raw fish without the flame searing. The flavor was good but that of the actually fish, somewhat subdued. I ordered a few pieces of Nigiri salmon and Hamachi with plain soy sauce and the fish itself did not seem as ""fresh"" as other places. This may have been due to the palette being prepared with the Aburi style.There is a great selection of hot and cold Sake and the Kozaemon #6 was excellent! The menu is varied and features lots of Japanese traditional dishes with a modern twist.I had the Miku Signature Selection of sushi with several types of fish in the Oshizushi style or ""pressed"" sushi. The presentation is artful and the flavors varied but again it simply did not rock my taste buds. However, it may have also been the high expectation built up as the food runners explain in great detail the composition of every piece on the dish.The Opera Green Tea dessert is visually pleasing and excellent in taste. It combines the wonderful taste of green tea ice cream with a seven layer cake. It really is a wonderful dessert.Overall Miku is a visually pleasing dining experience and if you score a table at the back of the restaurant on a clear day with the stimulating view of the harbor (I was there on a miserably rainy cold evening with no view) it's a dining experience that's hard to beat. Yes, it is expensive so if you plan to dine there on a budget you may be disappointed. However if you are entertaining business clients or guests or there on a special occasion, Miku does deliver a grand experience.",12/29/2015,4 star rating
650,Varmit P.,"Houston, United States",Great food in a really nice atmosphere.

652,Tanya G.,"Vancouver, BC","One of my personal favorites for sushi and ambience in town. I held off coming here for a while just so I find the best opportunity to try Miku. Eventually, I caved and came here for an anniversary only to be thoroughly pleased at how well our server took care of us - attentive, kind and our table was met with complimentary yet delicious small dishes throughout the evening. We had the AAA Sterling Silver Filet Mignon, pan seared scallops, aburi sashimi selection and the Salmon Oshi Sushi to share between two people. The sterling silver filet mignon was slow cooked so it was very soft and tender, the scallops were a perfect complementary dish, and the aburi sashimi selection was our spontaneous dish. I preferred the scallops to the sashimi selection, but the conflicting taste of the aburi selection became perfectly fine after a nice, refreshing glass (or two) of Aperol Spritz. The ambience at night was calming since it was right next to the sea, and especially more fun with a unique selection of cocktails to choose from. Overall, their salmon sushi was my absolute favorite -- it melts directly in your mouth, almost butter-like and creamy, and the full portion was very good for two people. The 'special Miku sauce' only made me more curious about it, but it's only one of many mouthwatering reasons as to why I think about the salmon oshi sushi almost every week.",12/16/2017,5 star rating
653,Dennis A.,"Surrey, BC","Just today, we decide to eat here after our first time flyovercanada experience . Expecting a good late lunch but disappointed of poor service. Firstly, the receptionist ask me if we want outside or inside table, I said Inside, I asked my wife she said outside so we decide to go outside table.I clearly stated that we want outside and the lady still send us to inside table and ask her why giving us inside table? I don't clearly heard  what she said but what ever reason she has is not acceptable. When we decide for outside table we're still in reception areaSecondly, Giving us tablespoon for our cold miso soup that's why one of my kids spilled the soup because of the heavy spoon luckily the soup is cold. Lastly, Putting candles in our table while we're still eating. I think    That's for dinner set up, so rude. Is this what you called classy restaurant. Good for kids?

655,Chloe G.,"Irving, United States","If I could give this restaurant ten stars, I would! The food is fabulous! Fresh, unique, each dish teases your palate. The desserts is to die for, green tea tiramisu & chocolate banana mousse. Even their green tea taste different than your typical Japanese restaurant. The best restaurant we dined at in Vancouver  We told the waiter Thomas to order for us & he did a fabulous job. He gives exceptional service . The tuna belly is a MUST ORDER, Melt in your mouth! Heavenly. The sushi is aburi style, rectangle shape. Reservations is totally compulsory. (If you're a tourist, make sure you do the ""Flyover Canada"", a 4D experience located next door .

656,Christine Y.,"Kirkland, United States","We came to the well acclaimed Miku to cap off our ""mom and dot"" Vancouver weekend. And I can't help but to pat myself on the back for insisting we drive into the city from the outskirts of Richmond to partake in this culinary experience.First, I had made a reservation for opening time (11:30am, weekday lunch)  but didn't actually make it until noon. OpenTable had already cancelled our reservation but they happily led us to our seat after a few brief minutes of wait. We got to sit outdoors on the patio, facing Canada Place (read: the waters), and had the best view of the people down on the street level and the blue skies and the mountains beyond.We shared the calamari, Premium lunch (12 pieces of sushi, half aburi oshi style), and Green Tea Opera Cake between the two of us, which was more than enough food. All were amazing and we would order again. The pickled beet and cucumber were a nice accompaniment to the fried calamari, which had the lightest tempura batter. The Premium lunch came with an assortment of sushi (hamachi, salmon, scallop, shrimp), two pieces of a tuna roll, and salmon and mackerel aburi oshi sushi. Our favorite in the Premium lunch was the salmon oshi sushi (great with the jalapeno pepper on top) and the shrimp with pesto on top was surprisingly good, too. The dessert was also delicious and plated so beautifully. My only complaint is that I will never find bitter green tea ice cream ever again. Had it once in Tokyo and everything else just tends to be overly sweet and too cream-y. As in, the ratio tends to lean towards the sugar and cream. I want more actual matcha flavor. The Opera cake itself was good though, and thank goodness for some tartness from the fresh fruit and dollops of what I assume to be mango sauce.Lastly, the service. Service was the perfect balance of friendly and efficient. We loved how everything was described to us as it was brought to the table, and when we mentioned we were in a rush, our server Caley (sp?) brought the card machine to our table so we could make it back to our car as quickly as possible. Loved every bit of our experience and will happily return when in Vancouver again!",9/14/2017,5 star rating

659,Susanna C.,"San Francisco, United States","I had to let my dining experience settle in for a few days before writing an elaborate review. Firstly, I am from San Francisco, so I would say we are snobbier than most when it comes to sushi. And coffee. And everything else probably. I was really excited to try this place out because of all the shining reviews on Yelp. We arrived at the time of our reservation and were seated immediately so that was nice. However, my request to have window seating was not fulfilled - would've been nice if they asked whether we prefer to wait a bit for a window seat rather than seating us anywhere immediately, we would've waited for the seats. Anyways, then we were handed menus to browse. We ordered a bunch of stuff to try, and I must say, I wasn't blown away.  At all. The sushi was mediocre at best. We got the tofu salad, soba peperoncino, baked sablefish entree, premium nigiri plate, premium aburi nigiri plate, Miku roll, aburi salmon oshi sushi, aburi saba oshi sushi. The good:Let me start off by saying, our favorite was the tofu salad and baked sablefish. I know I know, tofu salad sounds so plain but it was such a beautiful symphony of flavors. I just wish they gave more toppings... There were two thinly shaved pieces of apple on top. A few more shavings would've been nice... The sablefish was so delicious, it just melts in your mouth and was cooked to perfection. I don't really get the bed of brown rice quinoa stuff underneath the fish though. It was sort of like fried rice?... Doesn't go well with the delicate fish. I would come back for those two items. Onto the other stuff.The rest:The soba dish... Was good but it was not worth the price even as an appetizer. It had the influence of Italian pasta but with soba noodles. The Miku roll was not good. At all. I don't know what all the reviews are talking about. It was pricey too, sheesh. Flavors just didn't mix well in my mouth. *shrug*The famous aburi oshi sushi. I'm not sure if it's because they have to squish the sushi to make it flat and rectangular, but BOY were the pieces of fish on top thin! So thin, I think I tasted the flamed mayo on top the most, then the rice, mixed in with some texture of raw fish. I enjoyed the aburi saba oshi sushi more. The flamed top was some kind of miso sauce and that just elevated the flavor of the saba fish. But again, super thin pieces of fish on top. Onto the nigiri plates. Hm. I don't know. The fish were ok, nothing too special. I've had fresher fish elsewhere for a fraction of this price. The aburi nigiri was not that good either. The toppings they provide kind of overpowered the fish, so I couldn't even tell what each fish tasted like. Lastly, I was a little disappointed that they didn't remember my memo of it being my mother's birthday that day. Usually, if I'm shelling out $200+ for a three people meal, I would think that a restaurant would remember a small but important detail that I noted at reservation. Anyways, the server asked if we wanted dessert, and I had to awkwardly whisper (with my mom right in between us) whether she can put a candle on it... Candle appeared so I guess, thanks? The green tea opera cake was way too sweet for us. Even shared among three people was almost too much. One thing to note, our server came to our table once to check if things were ok, but that was it. All in all, for $200+, I would not visit this place again. The view wasn't even that nice!",10/19/2016,3 star rating

664,Ant L.,"Burnaby, BC","DOV 2016A bit underwhelmedCame here on the first day of Dine Out Vancouver. Well, whoever transcribed their online reservation to their own restaurant reservation screwed up, even though I received a reminder email to show that my record was correct. Luckily they were not too busy and had the bar table available. Otherwise it would have been an ugly scene.Food-wise, the 4 individual appy dishes were all enjoyable, with the crab claw being the standout. However, it's nothing to write home about, actually quite lacking in creativity (mashed potato served underneath a piece of sirloin steak with gravy, how original). The main course was a 5-piece sushi plate. I did enjoy the 2 pressed salmon sushi, very nice flavour with a touch of spiciness. But the tuna lacks the juiciness that usually comes with the fat being torched. In fact, it's to the point of being dry. The dessert unfortunately suffered from an ill thought out presentation. The cream is on the sweet side that was supposed to balance the bitterness of the cake that was drenched in coffee liquor. But if you didn't spoon both parts evenly, you will find it either too sweet or too bitter. Although in general, the food quality was not bad, but portion wise was really below average. The waiter actually asked us if we were full after the sushi plate, so perhaps a scheme to get people to order more. To be fair, their tasting menu is usually $68 with an addition of a meat or fish dish (also full nigiri sushi instead of rolled sushi for DOV menu), so their value for money is consistent from regular menu to Dine Out menu. However, overall, I would go back to Kingyo before contemplating Miku again.",1/16/2016,3 star rating

In fact, just passing by will produce a strong salivatory reaction. Your taste buds have a brain of their own right? I came in here on two occasions - once for dinner and once for lunch. Both times the service was impeccable, even if you did not have a reservation as we did not for lunch. The staff is very attentive, always smiling, and very knowledgeable about the items on their menu. I ordered:1) Miso soup: 9.5/10 lunch onlySeriously one of the best miso soups I've ever had - not too salty, and some enoki mushrooms that add some bite and accentuate the umami flavour of the miso. 2) Kaiso seaweed salad: 9/10 dinner, 7.5/10 lunchAt dinner this dish is a playful mix of textures - from the crunch of the fresh seaweed and tender lotus root, to the healthy creaminess from the avocado slices. The acidity from the ponzu-sesame vinaigrette complimented the bitterness of the greens beautifully. However, I felt like the version they plate for lunch falls a bit flat. No avocado and less dressing made this dish more dry and in need for acidity to counter the one-note umami flavour. 3) Salmon oshi sushi: 10/10 dinner, 7/10 lunchTHIS is what you come for if you come to Miku. The first time I had it, I honestly couldn't carry a conversation because this dish carried me away into a culinary paradise. Both times the salmon was incredibly fresh, slightly smoky, and melted in your mouth. The rice was cooked with some firmness to the bite, which makes me wonder if other sushi places in Vancouver lean towards overcooking it to a mushier consistency. I also liked the little kick from the jalapeño pepper on top. However, most of the creaminess in their lunch version came not from the salmon on top - cut more thinly this time around - but from the abundance of sauce underneath it. It was too rich.4) Miku roll: 10/10 lunch onlyIn case you've come here too many times for the salmon oshi, you'll get a renewed dopamine rush from this roll. It starts with the components that made the salmon oshi shine - the buttery slices of salmon are also torched to add some smoky undertones - but the sweetness of the crab and salty crunch from the blanket of masago that covers the roll takes it over the top. 10/10, would do again. 5) King roll: 8/10 lunch onlySimple yet clean flavours. I liked the creamy sauce on top and there was nice crunch from the tempura. Solid overall. Based on my two experiences, I would make a reservation. The sushi bar - where you would most likely be seated without a reservation - is more noisy and definitely less intimate than a separate table. But I would also recommend that you come in for dinner instead. The quality of food was a tad better. Well worth the higher price tag and your time. You have to experience what Miku has to offer at least once if you're in Vancouver.",6/29/2017,5 star rating

672,Kait M.,"Richmond, BC","This is my second time coming here in 3 weeks. The first time was for lunch and ordered the miku zen box which comes with 4 different seasonal dishes and their famous aburi sushi. Also ordered the green tea opera dessert - OMG it was the most beautiful/delicious dessert I think I may have ever had. They said it takes about a week to make given all the different components - this is a must try. See photo for details.The second time was for a bday dinner in the private room. We were fortunate enough to order omakase (which I think is something they only do at Minami now.) Each dish was amazing. Courses were spread out enough that we were so full by the end of the 3+ hour meal/experience.Overall - highly recommended. Definitely one of the best restaurants in the city especially for japanese food. Service was awesome - very attentive, just what you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre. Can't wait to go back!",10/12/2015,5 star rating
673,Doug W.,"Des Plaines, United States","Hands down the best sushi I've ever had. Eating here seriously changed my perspective on sushi. I have never been a huge fan of sushi and so, walking in, I didn't have high expectations. We ordered Aburi Oshi Sushi and Salmon Nigiri and after the first taste, my opinion of sushi changed immediately.The Aburi Oshi Sushi was phenomenal. I'm not sure what they do to it but it's some kind of magic because even the rice tasted extraordinary. The roll felt like it melted in my mouth (in a good way). I definitely struggled between devouring it right away and savoring every taste slowly. The restaurant was very clean. Service was fast and our waiter was extremely professional. We sat in the outdoor seating section and enjoyed a lively view of Canada Place. Some of the indoor seating options had some incredible views of the harbor. Prices were normal for a classy sushi restaurant.I think everyone who at least tolerates sushi should give this place a shot. I know I'm glad I did. My wife is a huge fan of sushi and she said this place is definitely her favorite. TL;DR - Great vibe and great food. Get the Aburi Oshi Sushi.",9/10/2016,5 star rating
674,Christine G.,"North Saanich, BC","We tried Miku for lunch with my cousin because it was at the top of the Yelp list, and it definitely did not disappoint.First of all, the staff is extremely attentive and very knowledgeable regarding the menu. Our server had great suggestions for us for our cocktails, sushi, and dessert items. And the food was exquisite! Gorgeous presentation, and not your average sushi. This was filled with complex flavours and a fresh, clean taste. Our desserts were works of art and just as delicious. We were lucky enough to have a table beside the window, giving us a glorious view of the water.This was a very expensive lunch, but well worth it for a special visit.",3/29/2017,5 star rating
675,Dy K.,"Littleton, United States","Tho it's very pricey but they deserve it. The art was exceptional, the quality of the food, the ambience and the service are exceptional.

677,Jay P.,"Vancouver, BC","FANTASTIC food. I've been waiting for the right occasion to splurge a bit and I finally took the dive. Some of the best food I've ever eaten, without a doubt. Had the Kaizen set, which was very very good. I would give it a 4.5 if I could, as my only semi gripe was the portions are a bit small for the price. After tax and tip, 2 kaizen sets and 2 beers came to around $260. At $130/person, I should not have still been hungry after. Could have definitely eaten a couple more rolls, and I'm not a big guy either. But I get it, it's a quality over quantity thing. Would probably return at some point, but just not anytime soon due to the price and portions.",6/19/2018,4 star rating
678,Celina L.,"Vaughan, ON","If you're visiting Vancouver and nearby the waterfront, do check out Miku! Even if you aren't ordering anything, it's worth a peek. First off, the location is amazing. The scenic views and interior design make the atmosphere feel special. There were a couple parties and dressed up groups of people that Friday night, which just added to the classiness. As I wasn't planning on dining in, I ordered some take-out. As I was waiting for my order, the line up just kept getting bigger and bigger so I would recommend making some reservations before coming. When I was paying for my order, a gentleman was talking with the owner or the manager of the restaurant and he said it was the best sushi he's ever had, even in comparison to that time he went to Japan. Haha.I ordered the King Roll (prawn tempura, cucumber, crab, tobiko, sweet chili aioli; $17) and didn't get a chance to eat it until about 20 minutes later. By then, the taste was only ok. I'd love to try this place out again and actually eat there.",11/6/2017,4 star rating
679,Bri T.,"Las Vegas, United States","Good sushi. Aburi and oishi is outstanding.  They are starting to get some interesting fish but could be better.

680,Joyce T.,"Boston, United States","Every time I'm in Vancouver, I make sure to make a reservation at Miku because their salmon aburi sushi is to die for. I honestly think it's the best sushi I've ever had. Sometimes I'm tempted to fly from Boston just to indulge my sushi craving.

Miku was highly recommended to us by a local, and that recommendation was 100% spot on.Try the seaweed salad.  Unlike anything I've ever had.  Without making reservations, except to wait for a table.  But the wait is will worth the dining experience.  You're going to love this place; guaranteed.",8/19/2016,5 star rating
682,Allison F.,"Miami, United States","Best sushi that has ever passed these lips, hands down.I met a man from Vancouver in a workout class and he told me that if I could eat at one place in the city, it had to be Miku. In town for a conference, I decided to go solo for lunch on a Thursday. The waiter gave me a thorough rundown of the menu, and I ultimately chose the premium sushi lunch.Lunch started with a yummy but somewhat ordinary miso soup. But the sushi that followed was extraordinary.The premium lunch was an assortment of their torched aburi sushi (salmon and miso mackerel), sushi and some specialty rolls. The fish was beyond fresh but what impressed me most was the way each set of fish and flavors was so perfectly curated and balanced. The sauces or adornments on each piece of fish worked in total harmony.I loved my lunch so much that I went back again for dinner that same night, this time with a much larger group. We shared a ton of stuff, including much of what I already tasted plus calamari, the maduro tuna app, soba seafood noodles and signature nigiri plate. Way too much food, but we all worked together to finish every last bite.On my way back to Miami now and I already miss Miku. If you can, get there ASAP.",6/4/2016,5 star rating
683,John T.,"Vancouver, BC","This is probably the best Japanese food in Vancouver, along with their sister restaurant Minami in Yaletown. The Salmon Oshi sushi is to die for. A beef dish which I forgotten the name of was simply fabulous. If you are looking for cheap sushi dishes, this is not the place to go. A bit more pricey than many sushi restaurants, but there is no comparison to in the quality of food.",11/6/2018,5 star rating

685,Andrew W.,"Seattle, United States","The sushi is really, really good.I visited Miku last week and was really impressed. First off, I'm glad I made reservations because it felt nice being whisked past all of the walk-in folks waiting for a table. The restaurant itself looks really nice, but pales next to the view of Coal Harbour that you get. Looking out on the water while eating was really nice, and the food itself was beautifully prepared, making the whole visual experience really worthwhile.We ordered the Coal Harbour Platter, Premium sushi lunch, and Green Tea Opera.Coal Harbour Platter - Beautifully large prawns, delicious oysters, clams, mussels, ceviche, and poke are hard to say no to in any setting. The whole presentation was great to look at and tasted pretty good, but I would be okay trying something different next time.Premium sushi lunch - The Aburi nigiri here is amazing, and I know I'm getting it again when I go back. The sushi was all nicely prepared and tasted great, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be haunted by desire for this Aburi nigiri sushi.Green Tea Opera - Their most popular dessert, and completely worth the acclaim. The homemade ice cream was delicious and paired really well with the 12-ish other things going on on the plate. It was really exciting diving into each individual element of the dessert, and then composing a spoonful of the whole opera and seeing how it combined together.Miku really is as good as it gets. The food was delicious, the service was courteous, the view was amazing, and the dining room was clean and elegant. I can't wait to go back again.",1/21/2016,5 star rating
686,Choo C.,"Burbank, United States","Soooo impressed by this place.  Our waiter, Thomas, was awesome and provided excellent service.  He had so much personality and made great recommendations on food and drinks. Ordered the aburi salmon, aburi ebie, the scalllops, the red wave for food. For a cocktail, Thomas just asked if I liked sweet, nonsweet or bitter cocktails and if I like beets.  He then brought over one of the best cocktails I have ever had.  The aburi was soooo good and so different than any other sushi I have had.  I usually don't like rice with sushi, but this rice is amazing and melts in your mouth. The scallops were perfectly cooked.  The red wave roll was delicious. For dessert, Thomas recommended the machta opera cake with green tea ice cream, which was gorgeous and delicious.  So sad that I don't live in Vancouver to enjoy this deliciousness all the time.",9/16/2018,5 star rating

It was all very well prepared and the tastes are so delicate and varied. The quality of the fish is good and it's nice to try some of the more fusion dishes. The presentation is also something to be excited about with each visit. Since it's moved to the newer location, parking has been harder to find. There's just the usual metered parking ($6 per hour). Cleanliness is always top notch and so is the service. The view is something to also be excited about.",12/10/2015,4 star rating
689,Esther T.,"Issaquah, United States","My cousin recommended this place for the aburi sushi, so my husband and I went to try it! When we made reservations, the only times available were 5pm or 8:30pm. We chose 5, and got seated exactly on time. Once we ordered, some dishes came out fast. Others took over 45 minutes. We were shocked of the delay, especially because when we ordered, there weren't too many people seated throughout the restaurant. I've never heard of such a slow kitchen before. Food wise, the sushi was delicious! Very tender fish. We got two rolls, one sashimi platter, salmon aburi, unagi nigiri, and an appetizer.",4/23/2016,4 star rating
690,Anastasya A.,"Los Angeles, United States","This is definitely my favourite restaurant in Vancouver. The ambiance here is amazing, whether it be for lunch or dinner, especially when you sit inside and get the view of Canada Place. I probably eat here at least once a month, it's probably me and my mom's go-to place. Lunch - The Chirashi Tart is a must when you come here for lunch. It is similar to the Aburi but has different toppings that just make it all the better. The plating in this restaurant is also amazing, and the tart is almost too pretty to eat. Dinner - Miku is best known for their aburi, and they never disappoint. The combination of the rice and the fish and sauce is simply amazing, and it just melts in your mouth. My favourite is definitely the Salmon Oshi, with the Saba Oshi coming as a close second. You will never go wrong with these two. The Calamari is a great appetizer, the tosazu sauce that they drizzle on top balances the taste and their tofu salad is also great. I like the salad for dinner better since they serve it with fried tempe, which is a delicacy where I come from. The Soba Pepperocino is also something I get during my visits, I think that this is definitely my favourite soba dish I have ever tried. They give you a generous amount of seafood, which is definitely a plus point. For dinner, they also have the trio scallop, and it is to die for. Each scallop is made with different sauces, and they are all delicious. Dessert - Their most popular dessert is definitely the Green Tea Opera cake. It's a must try, and there's always room for dessert! I think I've probably tried every dessert that they have, and they are all good. Our server, Thomas, is always amazing. He gave us free miso soup and dessert last time, and it simply made our day. Every one of the staff is friendly and attentive to our needs, so every aspect of this restaurant is truly great.",10/12/2017,5 star rating
691,Danwei M.,"Berkeley, United States","I forgot to make a reservation so my parents and I had to sit at the bar. I've been to Miku too many times to not know how good it is. The Aburi Salmon is my all time favorite. We ordered 3 sets which comes down to 18 pieces. The waiter looked confused and asked me if I really waited three sets and I said yes haha. My family doesn't eat anything raw so every time we're here we get some sushi's, a lot of appetizers, and sometimes the steak. For dessert, we always go with the green tea cake!",4/15/2018,5 star rating
692,Dee G.,"Phoenix, United States","One word: DELICIOUS!! Miku moved to a new location since we had last been here. There are beautiful views from the dining area. We started off our meal with various nigiri, the most amazing of which was the spot prawn nigiri. Everything was excellent that we tried, the toro, albacore, salmon, etc, but the spot prawn was the star of the show, likely because they were in season. We also tried a couple of rolls, all of which were great, but the best roll was their aburi style roll, with the fish gently seared on top. This restaurant is a do not miss if you like sushi and come to Vancouver!",6/8/2016,5 star rating
693,Malia H.,"Honolulu, United States","We were looking for a sushi place since I heard that they have super fresh fish here and I have try sushi in Vancouver. Plus I was looking for sushi, specifically uni. I saw uni on the menu but they said they were out and it wasn't in season. so I was kind of disappointed but decided to eat here anyways.Miku is located on the waterfront near Canada Place. You can sit indoors or outdoors. The restaurant has a lot of natural light and has a nice contemporary feel to the place. Miku serves Aburi style sushi. In case you're like me and don't know what that means, Aburi sushi (炙り寿司, roasted sushi) consists of nigiri sushi with a fish topping that is partly grilled and partly raw. We came on a Thursday night at 7pm without a reservation. It was an hour wait which actually turned out to be 45 minutes. They will take your phone number and call you when a table is ready. Another cool thing is that they have wi-fi. You just need to ask the hostess for the password. We were seated at the glass bar. The bar is located in the middle of the room and is a beautiful centerpiece in the room since its made of glass. The ceilings had bright large painted fish. The place had a nice fushion feel to it.The sake was a bit expensive so we settled on some Kirin and Asahi bottles of beer. We already ate so we didn't order too much. We ordered oyster shooters which had seaweed, ikura, yuzu zest and dashi ponzu along with the oyster that you take like a shot. They were nice and salty but the nice thing was the yuzu took away that sea taste. We also ordered the Miku signature selection ($35) which basically was an omakase style plate of sushi with traditional, aburi nigiri, oshi and specialty rolls. I wish I could remember what was on the plate but I forgot. There were two pieces of specialty roll, fresh scallops, amaebi and the fried head, negitoro, 2 Aburi sushi and 3 fish nigiri pieces. Everything was fresh. The amaebi head was huge and fried so it was nice and crunchy as you bit through the shell. The pieces do change depending on seasonality and availability. We also ordered a tobiko and bincho toro piece. Both those pieces were good but nothing out of the ordinary. The bartender who was our waiter was friendly and fun. We met a nice couple at the bar too, who we chatted with for awhile.  If you sit at the bar, you'll definitely make some friends. This place is a bit pricey but the ambiance, service and food are worth it.",8/25/2015,4 star rating

We tried out : Oyster Shooter first, it came in a shot glass with the oyster at the bottom.

But it did get quite greasy after awhile.Miku Roll, was very nice, I loved the texture of the tobiko (fish roe). Makes the sushi more interesting to eat.For dessert we had the: Green Tea Opera, it's one of there popular dish. I can tell why it was so popular, the green tea was very strong which I loved with the match ice cream. A must order for sure!

I'm not a big fan of cooked salmon or any kind of mackerel, but how they paired the natural flavors of the fish and their sauces resulted in such a delicious transformation I couldn't get enough!

The drinks aren't too bad and our server was very knowledgable and friendly.What was strange is their actual Sashimi was not near the quality I would expect.

The food was fresh and tasty. We really enjoyed the beef carpaccio appetizer. The meat was thinly sliced but packed with flavor. The raw egg on top added a creamy texture to the dish. The aburi plate was good but I wish there was more fish than mayo. Generally the aburi just tasted very creamy and heavy. The sashimi plate was really good, I would definitely recommend.

First impressions, big restaurant with plenty of seating.  The whole north side is windows overlooking the water, candle lit setting, very nice.Came here for valentines day for 7pm reservations.  We ordered:- Ebi Fritters 5pcs ($15) - Aburi Beef Carpaccio ($19.50) - Oysters On Half Shell 6pcs ($MP)- Salmon Oshi Sushi 6pcs ($17.00)- Ebi Oshi Sushi 6pcs ($17.00)- Miku Roll 8pcs ($20.00)- Dark Chocolate Raspberry Pave ($21.00)Everything was plated beautifully and tasted great.  The portions were small, but the visual presentation is half of it.  I found that the oshi sushi had a little too much rice and the special valentines day dessert had too much going on.Service was exceptional. The server explained the menu to us (it was my first time here).  As we were ordering, he suggested that we had already ordered a fair amount of food.  Every dish when brought out was described to us.Opted not to snap pics during this special occasion.  Didn't want to be ""THAT GUY"" today.

We were treated so kindly and the food was beautifully prepared - It was fresh and addicting. We ended up ordering 2 Salmon Oshi Sushi, a Miku roll, a Red Wave Roll and Ortoro Nigiri. Then, like gluttons, ordered the Valrhona chocolate orange gateau for dessert, which they generously gave to us complimentary. It was a perfect ending to a memorable meal. We enjoyed every bit of it.  The atmosphere, the location, the service and most importantly the food were all wonderful.",5/20/2019,5 star rating

712,Jennifer V.,"Plano, United States","Sorry fellow Yelpers, gotta take the road less rated on this place and say 4.5 stars out of thousands? I just lost a little trust in Yelp reviewers...Wed night, 9 p.m., no reservation, so we understandably waited 30 mins for 2 seats at the bar. LOTS of young customers noted, and tourists - right at cruise terminal. Classy restaurant but saw a surprising # of REALLY casual tourist patrons. Bartender was a cool guy, suggested a great house saki. We love good, fresh sushi and we will pay a lot for a great, creative sushi meal. Usually sashimi (yes, straight RAW FISH) with a couple of interesting rolls to accompany. But we wanted to try this famous seared sushi, not something available at the other sushi restaurants around.So we got the recommendations of what's most popular & noteworthy: 2 pressed seared sushis & 2 seared rolls. He warned us no wasabi or soy sauce because accoding to the chef, the flavor is already perfect.  PPPFFFTTTTT.Bottom line: SPECIALTY = BORING. THIS IS THE SUSHI FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE SUSHI.We both thought all 4 of them were really bland, even the pressed one with a tiny slice of jalapeno was just a little spicy-bland. The pressed sushi with seared mayo stuff on top was way too sweet! The pressed rice was not just sticky, it was STICKY and shiny and overly-sweetened. I carved 50% off the bottom of each bite to get some more flavor ratio from the top sear layer. It's $17 for 8 bites of sweet, sticky rice with a ""smear"" of ground(?) shrimp that we didn't taste, but did see the pink color. Which is BRILLIANT in creating a better margin of food costs. Seriously, GOOD for this chef. He's got the tourist niche on the waterfront & has the media buzz. As another reviewer said, very ""Westernized"" sushi. Which is cool culinary evolution. But for our palates, western food in general is overly sweet and really starchy, & I don't like it. Irony: THAT'S WHY I LOVE SUSHI, because it's not (usually) that! MY BAD - I SHOULD HAVE SCROLLED FOR THE LOWER STARRED REVIEWS to see why they didn't rave... When a place rated this highly, I assume the lows are bad service, or angry ex-employees - some one-off. Had I bothered to read them, I would have figured out before going that this isn't our sushi jam, as the minority low-raters we are in general say the same thing - MEH.We were literally whispering to each other, ""WTF are people so excited about??"" When the bartender exuberantly asked if we liked his recommendations, we lied to be nice, because there wasn't anything WRONG with it that could be fixed. I didn't bother finishing my half, as one roll was a bit fishy (remember, I eat straight sashimi, so this isn't the opinion of a raw fish novice), and the other was just not interesting. Ironically, with wasabi & soy & ginger to mask, I would have at least finished. Another bartender asked if I was really done and didn't want more, as she said most people really eat way more than we did. Again, lied to be nice because there was nothing to ""fix"" - told her I just wasn't very hungry.TRUTH: We usually gorge on sashimi and interesting, flavorful rolls, which is USUALLY why our bill is so high.  Here it was just a high bill for rice snacks. And yes as others say it took a LONG time for food to arrive, even with no less than 25 bodies in the kitchen. Their overhead must be insane, that's BIG RENT right on the waterfront.PLUS: sake was good.",8/9/2018,2 star rating
713,Richmon L.,"Kenmore, United States","We had a great experience at Miku. Service was attentive and had our table ready within a few minutes of our reservation time. Our waiter guided us through the menu and made great recommendations. We thoroughly enjoyed the sterling prime rib, chef's selection sushi platter, and Ebi fritters. They even threw in one extra Ebi fritter to split them evenly among our table. The view was fantastic as well, and they even added a ""Happy Anniversary"" to the dessert platter at the end.

714,Chase H.,"Salt Lake City, United States","I was really excited to try this place. Perhaps I had the wrong idea about it. The food was very good.

715,Kat J.,"Jersey City, United States","This was my favorite restaurant during our trip through the Northwest.  I knew I wanted to try a sushi place during my short stay in Vancouver, and after reading through numerous reviews, we decided to try this place.  It was definitely the right decision.  We arrived approximately 45 minute earlier than our reservation, as we were still on EST and didn't want to fall asleep halfway through dinner.  I was hoping to be seated a bit early as the dining room looked half empty.  Unfortunately, all of the tables were reserved and they asked us to wait at the narrow hallway by the front door.  I asked if we can wait by the bar instead and have a pre-dinner drink there.  I didn't realize at the time that the bar was used to seat people that are looking to order food as well.  It was nice of them to allow us to just sit at the bar and order drinks while waiting for our dinner.  The bar is positioned in the middle of the dining room and had great views of the water as the bar chairs are higher than the rest of the dining room chairs.  Pro tip, it is actually not a bad place to eat dinner, therefore if you don't have a reservation, ask to be seated at the bar and order there.  We were seated by the window at our appointed time,  Even though, our view from the table was mostly of the oil tanker, I didn't really mind as I was here for the food.  I rather have good food than good views!  See below for the dishes we tried:Saba Oshi Sushi - my favorite dish of the night! The miso sauce on top of the mackerel was lightly seared and was a perfect complement to the fish.  The waiter advised us that the use of soy sauce was not necessary, and boy, was he right.  The sushi is well-seasoned on its own, no need for any additional condiments.  I am normally not a big fan of rice and tend break off most of the rice when I have a sashimi-style roll, but for this dish, I actually enjoyed the sushi rice as it was seasoned and cooked perfectly.Premium Aburi Nigiri - the 7 nigiri in this dish were really fresh and each came with its own sauce.  I think it contained mackerel, salmon, tuna, yellowtail, scallop and shrimp.  My favorite was definitely the mackerel (what can I say, I love cheap fish ;)  Each piece of fish was so tender that I can easily cut through them with my chopstick, like butter.  This dish also has no need for soy sauce or wasabi, it can stand on its ownMiku Roll - unfortunately they were out of uni the night we were there.  As I was eating this roll, I thought about how much better it would be if it had uni.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good roll without the uni, but I think it would've been excellent with it.Bouillabaisse - the only dish of the night that I wasn't super impressed with.  It was a good bouillabaisse, but not amazing, and I had high expectations for this restaurant.  I personally think the fennel and herbs overpowered the broth, they could also use less salt in the dish as well.  Moreover, the toasted baguette felt like it sat out for too long after being toasted, thus it was a bit toughGreen Tea Opera - dark chocolate and green tea is always a good combination. Overall, I loved most of the dishes I've tried here (with the exception of bouillabaisse), but I should've known better to order a traditional French dish at a place that is famous for its sushi.  The cocktails were so-so, and I stopped after one because I wasn't that excited to try another one.  The service was great, our waiter was attentive and even offered to take multiple pictures of us once dessert was served.  If I am ever in Vancouver again, I would love to come back!",9/12/2015,5 star rating
716,Andy K.,"Markham, ON","Probably the best ever tasting sushi eaten ever. The oshi aburi sushi's were so delicious it's hard to put into words. Both the Salmon and Ebi were so good. Having them sear the top of the fish a little bit just makes eating sushi to a different level. Also tried the Bouillabaisse soup and that was also very tasty as well. They had every kind of seafood you could ask in the soup, there was squid, muscles, clams, prawm, tuna, scallops and a few potato's too. The soup was hearty and had very good taste. It wasn't too peppery or salty. With so many different types of seafood it didn't dilute the soup or make it taste fishy at all. Also got to try the Red wave and Miku rolls, and I must say after these rolls, im probably going to rethink what good sushi rolls taste like after. No soy sauce needed. All the ingredients put into the rolls were absolutely bomb. Fish was again had a lil bit of heat because of the charring and that makes it more delicious because it's so soft. All the fish they make at Miku is like 'heaven food' its all nicely marinated and the sauces and ingredients they use are addictive. Absolutely, an addictive and very good place for high-end sushi. The Oshis sushi's Salmon or Ebi are top choices to pick from. Probably the most signature and most popular dishes there. The rolls are also very good. Definitely going to come here more than once. Next up is to try their Toronto location!",11/19/2015,5 star rating
717,Kailyn C.,"Vancouver, BC","Miku is a beautiful restaurant that serves fresh innovative sushi and lives up to its hype.Prior to trying the Aburi, I was once a girl who refused to eat any form of sashimi, but after tasting the finely torched fish, I simply love some pressed sushi with a pop of jalapeno. Along with it's Aburi selection, there are also many other specialty sushi and seafood selection. In addition, unlike other places where desserts are treated as secondary, Miku's  green tea opera is also made at a high caliber -  the cake was impressive and delicious. Located on Waterfront, the restaurant is big, classy and very west coast. It's chic, but not overly stuffy and proper.  In the summer, the patios are wonderful to dine in. Great place to bring a visitor, date or a love one for a special treat. There's an open kitchen staff with about a million staff you can view as they work hard to get your food ready.Overall, an excellent restaurant worth visiting and splurging.",11/3/2015,5 star rating
718,Thai N.,"West Hills, United States","Miku was just down the street from where we were staying during our vacation.  We didn't make reservations, but given that we were going for a relatively early dinner, we hoped there wouldn't be a problem.  As we arrived around 5:15, the place was packed!  Already a short line by the hostess desk.  We were very fortunate in that those waiting were larger parties and a table for 4 had just opened up.  The hostess got us in with a very short 10 minute wait as that table paid their bill.According to our waiter, what makes Miku, Miku is their aburi - pressed and seared sushi with a special sauce for each preparation.  I'm sure I'm doing a disservice to the description.  That said, we ordered their Salmon Oshi Sushi and Ebi Oshi Sushi.  Both lived up to the hype of our waiter.  Of the two, my favorite was the salmon - perhaps because it was my first taste.  Miku doesn't have any soy sauce since the aburi has a special sauce for each preparation.  With each bite there are so many layers of flavor!In addition to the aburi oshi, we also ordered a King Roll (prawn tempura).  The roll was quite good as well.  As noted, there is no soy sauce to be found so each roll was packed with flavor.Service was mostly attentive.  There were a couple times I had trouble flagging down our waiter to refill our drinks and to order another cocktail - by the way, I ordered the Miyazaki #2 cocktail.  It was incredibly refreshing on a summer day.  It's rare I order a 2nd cocktail, but this drink was so good, I ordered another.As noted, I strongly recommend making reservations!",8/26/2017,4 star rating
719,Kev S.,"San Diego, United States","Great modern Japanese restaurant with an awesome view of the harbor.  I've been here a couple times and have sat in both the indoor and outdoor seating.Ambiance:   Minimalistic yet sharp, but the interior noise was quite loud.  Most of my conversations were drowed in the background noise, and most other parties were leaning forward to hear what others were saying.     Outdoor seating is a little awkward because the tables are very low and there's a lot of honking from the cars on the streets and ships at the harbor.  Great view with comfortable sofas though!Food:   Ebi fritters - giant tiger prawns fried to perfection.  Juicy and soft encased in a crunchy shell.  Sauce on top was just enough and delicious! 5/5   Sushi platter - as this is more of a fusion restaurant, their nigiris are just ok.  Smaller in size and more lean than fatty.  3/5   Harbor platter - great selection of fresh shellfish.  Near you seafood restaurant Joe Forte's has much sweeter oysters, but the mussles and octopus are great.  4/5   Aburi Oshi Sushi - I tried all 3 options (salmon, shrimp, mackerel), and found all 3 to be flavorful but a little heavy on the rice.  The plum sauce on the shrimp is my favorite, but my other friends didn't enjoy it as much, so beware! 4/5   Lunch Miku Salad - well seasoned and just the right portion, would highly recommend! 5/5   Miku Roll - I honestly prefer these to the Aburi Oshis, and they have more substance to them.  I'd say if you're going for more actual ""sushi"", the Miku Roll is the way to go.  If you want more flavor and creamy-ness, go for the Aburi Oshis.Overall a great restaurant, but I can't give it a 5 star due to the overwhelming noise.",6/6/2018,4 star rating
720,Rick T.,"San Francisco, United States","I was excited to have my last dinner in Vancouver here, having read the reviews and browsed the menu ahead of time. The restaurant is in a great location, with views of the water. What I caught me off guard first was how loud the place was. I guess I had expected a ""fancier"" type of ambience given the location and price point of the restaurant, but when I walked in, it was very loud (Monday night).Our server came to us and told us about the restaurant and some of their highlighted menu options. Oh, and they don't have uni tonight. We were looking forward to that, as well as trying their Miku roll that had uni in it. We gave our cocktail order. The server told us that they don't have that cocktail tonight. This was not a good start to our dinner. So we gave another cocktail...oh wait, that one is not available as well. I'm thinking to myself how you don't have two out of the nine cocktails you listed on your menu, especially, I would assume your main cocktail, since it was listed first. For dinner we tried their special aburi salmon and mackerel, their ebi fritters, scallops, and some nigiri. The ebi fritters were very good...big plump shrimp with a light coating. The aburi looked better than it tasted. They tasted ok, but it was not memorable. If anything, I felt that these aburi style sushi had too much rice. All in all, it was not impressive, especially for the price you pay. (I had a mackerel sushi at Kingyo that looked similar to what's at Miku, but far better tasting.)I got that feeling that Miku is not a place for locals to dine at, but more for the nearby business crowd to wine and dine, the happy hour crowd for the bar deals, and for tourists looking for a fancy restaurant with a good view that are recommended to come here by nearby hotel concierges.",6/16/2017,2 star rating

722,Sandy E.,"Seattle, United States","I have been here once before, but this time I ordered more varieties of sushi! The salmon has the freshest, smokiest essence which seeps into the sticky rice beautifully. We also ordered the sampler platter which had a large breaded prawn in addition to short rib and some other sushi goodies.My only minus was our server--he was not cordial or warm whatsoever, which was especially strange since all other staff members were cheerful and welcoming. A minor infraction compared to the high quality of Miku's authentic sushi, but still worth noting.Come early or make a reservation because this place is uber popular and you will have to wait :)",3/29/2016,4 star rating
723,Jeff M.,"Waterville Valley, United States","I came to Miku based on Yelp reviews and the fact that I was staying at a nearby hotel and wanted a restaurant within walking distance. It was a Saturday night and we didn't make a reservation and Miku was busy. We were told it would be about 45 minutes, and it was very close to that estimate.This is an urban Sushi Restaurant right next to a SkyTrain station, so it was busy. We were sat fairly close to the hostess stand, unfortunately we weren't near the amazing views. Our server was Tony, he did a great job explaining the menu and the various dishes. He offered which dishes were the most popular and I remembered some dishes from other Yelp reviewers.This place is loud when it is busy. So loud it was hard to talk and hear. I came here with my in-laws who haven't had much, if any, sushi. This probably wasn't the best place to bring sushi newbies as this style of sushi is pretty modern and different than what I would consider traditional sushi. I think I read a review that said this is sushi fusion, I agree with this characterization.We ordered some traditional sushi items (green tea, edamame, sushi nigiri) but we also ordered some of the most recommended dishes like Salmon Oshi Sushi (rectangles of rice with fish and flame seared sauce on top) and the Red Wave Roll (crab and avocado wrapped in red tuna with sauce). Tony recommended we NOT dip our sushi in wasabi or the other sauce provided, this was an unusual request but I didn't dip. I would recommend this method, the flavors were varied and complex. The searing and delicate sauces on top were really flavorful.Since I wasn't dipping, I didn't mix wasabi with soy sauce as I usually do, which was too bad. I did try the wasabi separately and it was the best I have ever had. It was fresh and real, as far as I could tell. It had texture of horseradish root which I really liked. A lot of folks don't like wasabi due to it's hotness, but that's why I love it.In the end this is a really good different kind of sushi restaurant. Give it a try if you've had enough ordinary/traditional sushi lately.",10/21/2015,4 star rating

727,Kayla T.,"Boston, United States","My husband and I were oh so hopeful when we booked our reservation at miku, the reviews were great and it seemed like a lovely atmosphere for our splurge night out while on vacation. Sadly, we were not happy with our experience. We were confused by the menu options so asked the waitress to walk us through it. She explained the options and the seasonal kaisen kaiseki menu. She checked back in and we asked her a few more questions about the kaisen kaiseki menu before ordering. She suggested we both participate in the kaiseki menu due to timing. We thought it was only a suggestion. When we ordered only one person with the kaisen kaiseki menu, she said she would need to check with the manager. To us this was the equivalent of a prix fixe menu...the entire menu is not all chefs choice so we didn't understand the issue. We did not care about timing. She came back and told us the manager said we both needed to order it, they couldn't only serve it for one person. I think she was hoping we'd cave to pressure and both order it but unfortunately one of us disliked some of the menu items. After we decided to just order a few menu options instead of the kaiseki, our waitress kept trying to upsell us. I eventually had to ask her to stop and that we were happy with our order as it was.We were determined to have a nice night out so we put it behind us and we're excited to taste the food and drinks which people have raved about on Yelp. We ordered drinks. My husband's first two choices of cocktails were out. It was only 6:45 at night, how are you out of cocktail ingredients for two drinks on your regular menu? Unfortunately we were disappointed with the food too. The aburi was too rice heavy and the flavor was a bit strange. The nigiri we got was only ok, we've had better for cheaper. The sablefish was good but again we've had better elsewhere for cheaper. The best part was our dessert, the green tea opera, although we found the portion small. Overall, we wish we had gone elsewhere- the restaurant was pretentious and over priced for a subpar meal. I don't take leaving a bad review lightly but we felt surprised by our experience given the great reviews so wanted to post honestly about our experience.",9/4/2018,2 star rating

The lobster tail is seriously one of the best piece of lobster meat I've ever eaten. The way it was cooked and the sauces just make the meat so damn delicious. Words cannot describe it.I also had a good sampling their sushis which were all very delicious as well. You definitely can't go wrong with any of their special rolls or aburi ohsi sushi. They literally melt in your mouth.Service was prompt and attentive, but probably not as genuine as some would like borderline snobby or pretentious.

746,Thompson C.,"Dear Thompson,Thank you very much for taking the time to share your dining experiences with us. Firstly, thank you for your continuous support at Miku. We are sorry to hear that your most recent visit did not meet the standards that we are known for. We would like to discuss this with you further, could you please contact us at mikuvan@aburirestaurants…?",Disappointing. Used to frequent this place for its inventive dishes and delicious sushi. But recently visited and found that the menu has shrunken significantly. Some of my favourite dishes have disappeared from the menu. Previously the staff could usually whip up things off menu but this time I was not so lucky. Service was slow and not very attentive. No longer the restaurant it used to be,4/2/2019,2 star rating
747,Taylor Y.,"Los Angeles, United States","My boyfriend took me here for a birthday dinner celebration for just us two and let me say it was one of the best sushi places I have ever been to. We didn't make a reservation, but we only waited 20 mins until they seated us at a table that never showed for their reservation. The ambiance was nice and people were dressed in anything from sweats to nice dresses. Our waitress, Abby, was a ROCKSTAR! Super nice, very honest with her recommendations, and was very personable the entire night.Per her recommendation, we ordered the Ebi Fritters as an app. They are melt in your mouth to die for if you like shrimp tempura! For our main meal, we ordered and split the Sunset Roll, Salmon Oshi Sushi, & Salmon Nigiri. Amazing is the least I can say about all of them! The Oshi sushi was a very unique grill pressed style sushi with an interesting sauce and no seaweed-still VERY tasty! Abby even brought us something a little special for my birthday after we had a conversation about seeing Miku featured on The Worlds Best Sushi Restaurants on The Daily Meal. Overall we had a wonderful night & made a new friend, Abby, who also made recommendations of places we should also visit in Vancouver. Would definitely recommend to everyone wanting to find a nice place to have a elevated dining experience.",12/29/2017,5 star rating
748,Kim Q.,"Renton, United States","Made a reservation and they sat us down outside on the patio. We wanted to do the tasting menu but deemed that our coffee table was way to small.

749,Cynthia L.,"Burnaby, BC","I have been to Miku twice since I moved to Vancouver - once for lunch and once for dinner. The Sashimi Lunch special I had for lunch was good, but not amazing. I wouldn't  recommend coming to Miku if all you are interested in having is regular sashimi or (nigiri) sushi. There are many other spots in Vancouver that serve high-quality sashimi and nigiri in larger quantities and at a more reasonable prices.Their Aburi sushi, on the other hand, is a different story altogether. We asked our waiter to recommend an appetizer and he suggested the Aburi Beef Carpaccio without hesitation. I was sold after he told us that it came with an egg in the middle. From the Aburi Oshi Sushi list, he recommended the Salmon Oshi Sushi and the Ebi Oshi Sushi. He said that although Salmon is always the crowd favourite, he personally liked the Ebi one best. From his descriptions, we went with two orders of the Salmon Oshi Sushi and one order of the Ebi Oshi Suhi. Each order comes with six pieces. The Aburi Beef Carpaccio was absolutely delectable. It reminded me of the Butter Beef at Phnom Penh (minus the cilantro) - just as tender and flavourful. The carpaccio was prepared with sterling silver AAA short ribs and topped with a bed of organic baby greens, slivers of Asian pear, and a beautiful 64-degree organic egg. The dark sauce (as you can see in the picture) is jalapeno-garlic ponzu and the green dollops on the corners are pickled wasabi. I liked everything about this dish - from the beef itself ... to the tangy ponzu ... to the kick added by the pickled wasabi. At $19.50 per plate, it is on the pricier side, but totally worth it in my opinion!Melt-in-your-mouth - best description of the sushi that I can think of. The fish and prawns at the top of the sushi was perfectly blow-torched and so sooo tender and juicy. Blow-torching creates this effect, as the heat helps to melt down the fat. The Salmon Oshi Sushi was made with pressed BC Sockeye Salmon, topped with adorable mini slices of jalapeno, and finished with Miku's special sauce. The Ebi Oshi Sushi was topped with lime zest and finished with ume sauce. I loved the pairing of jalapeno with the salmon and lime zest with the prawns. The jalapeno brought out the freshness in the salmon and the tanginess of the lime zest and ume sauce brought out hints of sweetness in the prawns.As I mentioned above, if you're just looking to have some standard sashimi or sushi to satisfy a craving for Japanese food, Miku may not be the best place to go. However, if you're looking to really satisfy your taste buds and try something new ... the Aburi sushi at Miku is a must try!!!Read my full review with pictures at cyndod.blogspot.ca/2016/…",7/21/2016,5 star rating

755,Yu S.,"Vancouver, BC","A very nice experience in general. Great food, OK service, terrible neighbours. We ordered the Miku Zen box which came with four small dishes, 5 aburi sushi, and one miso soup. It was basically their dine out menu with less sushi. In addition to the Miku Zen, we ordered the ""Premium"" sushi lunch which came with 12 pieces of great specialty and aburi sushi along with a miso soup. Since today's lunch was a celebration of sorts, we also ordered the Green Tea Opera.That was way too much food. But because the food was really good, we finished them all anyways.I would especially recommend the salmon aburi sushi, which has been my favourite since the first time I came. The Green Tea Opera was great, but I preferred the ice cream much over the cake itself since I am not a huge fan of sweets.Service was mediocre. The server looked like he didn't want to be there and wasn't too eager when we chose to get hot water instead of something on the drinks menu. The food servers or bussers were, however, very nice.The kids sitting beside us were screaming and tossing things around the whole time. Everyone was terribly loud. Oh dear.",4/26/2015,3 star rating

762,Taylor Y.,"Vancouver, BC","I was invited by a friend to dine at Miku, and I must say I was very impressed. And by that I am referring to the consistency of the food there. I had the ""Miku Zen"", which is a nice collection of assorted sushi and various seasonal dishes. Have you ever dined at a place with an excellent starter, but the main course fell short? Well, Each of the items here were consistently very good. There were 8 distinct different foods in total, and they were all very consistent. This is definitely not a place to go every weekend, since things add up pretty fast. Think of it as a treat for a special occasion. Mine came close to $40 with tax and tip. But looking back, the portions were generous. You can tell that the chef paid a lot of attention and care into them. The waiter was very polite and attentive as well.

The restaurant itself was immaculate and clean with gorgeous views of the water. Easily the most gorgeous sushi restaurant I have ever been to. The service definitely matched the ambiance. Our server was warm, knowledgeable and attentive. The Aburi Style sushi was the best I've ever had and will now be what I compare all my seared style sushi to. The Aburi Style Sushi and Seafood is definitely what stands out here among other dishes. The fresh oysters were excellent and so were their other delicious offerings from the sea. The fish and chips were light and crispy but juicy and luscious at the same time. The Ebi Fritters were probably the best fried shrimp dish I've ever had! The sashimi was top grade as well. The other designer rolls were good but nothing spectacular.The drinks at Miku are also wonderful. Not too strong, full of fresh flavors and pretty to look at too. I had the Green Tea Opera Cake for dessert and it was magnificent and of course gorgeously played. Every single item that came out at Miku was not only delicious but a visual feast for the eyes!!!It is quite a beautiful experience here, pricey but well worth it. Stellar service, food and ambiance.

772,Claire D.,"San Diego, United States","Came here for lunch before leaving Vancouver and was glad I did. The 12 piece omakase is a great deal! This place was like the opposite of the other sushi bar we went to (Maumi), being large and relatively loud, with an assembly line kitchen. The sushi bar provides a good view, but it's not like you get to talk to your sushi chef who then hands you the food he just made you. They make the food, then it gets passed around until some other waiter brings it to you. Kind of weird. All the sushi comes sauced and dressed and beautiful. The selection of fish isn't extensive but all the things we had were tasty, though the aburi salmon sushi was our favorite. I liked the mackerel one as well, but the salmon one has a better fish to rice ratio. Other favorites were the albacore, yellowtail, and scallop. The shrimp fritters were huge, delicious, and lightly crispy. Overall, we really enjoyed our $100 lunch. So...minus one star for the slow service, expensiveness, and lack of more exotic fish. Really delicious dressy fashionable sushi though!",9/21/2015,4 star rating

774,Christopher Y.,"Manhattan, United States","The very definition of fine dining can be embellished with one visit to Miku. The clean transparent décor of the interior design, the large water-facing windows pouring bright light into the entire restaurant, is all very well put together. The only thing that makes you wow even more is the savory aburi sushi. Aburi sushi, for those not in know, is a sushi style which is seared with a small hand torch. The best seller in Miku is hands down, the aburi sushi. Our teeny group of 2, brought along 4 stomachs. We ordered the prawn appetizer with Caesar salad on the side, the seafood soba noodles, the chirashi tart, and too many pieces of Aburi tuna and salmon. The prawns are huge and meaty, and fried with a nice crispy shell. The seafood soba noodles were refreshing. The noodles were cold and the mix of octopus and shrimp served as a good appetizer. I honestly cannot remember the chirashi tart, it was nothing special and I am personally turned off by raw scallop but I must say the delivery is very neat. The fish, seafood, and rice are all stacked neatly into a cylindrical shaped tool, and after the chef is done topping the tart - it comes out looking like a colorful birthday cake. If there was only one item you could try at Miku, it's the aburi sushi. The special sauce they use (not your ordinary spicy mayo) and the just-right rice and perfectly seared fish, come together like no other sushi experience. Each piece reduces to butter at the tip of your tongue. A fantastic gastronomical experience. Not owing to price alone, but this restaurant is probably a one and done for tourists like me. Great experience but it's like going to a Broadway, I love it, but no need for a second round.P.S. Street parking is impossible here. Prepare to cough up big bucks to throw your vehicle in the Pan Pacific parking lot. Or be smart and take public transportation.",3/7/2017,5 star rating

778,Sam L.,"San Francisco, United States","Less than $30 USD for the chef's selection/omakase. AMAZING. the quality of the fish is so fresh, and we got to try their specialty which is aburi nigiri, which just means it is lightly seared using a blowtorch i believe. So ridiculously good. The servers explain all the different nigiri's/rolls on the chefs selection platter and they all taste better than the next! The bf and I would eat the pickled ginger in between each bite to try and make the fish last as long as humanly possible and we would discuss how this one was our favorite so far, but each time we tried a new piece that became our new favorite. I would be willing to go back to Vancouver  just for the sole purpose of eating dinner here, i'm obsessed. All of the sauces and the way the fish is dressed/topped is completely different and you don't feel like you are eating repeats of anything (which is how I feel sometimes just eating plain nigiri with wasabi and soy sauce). Note - if you don't eat spicy food, be aware that they do put wasabi in the nigiri already in between the fish and the rice, so don't be caught off guard! I don't eat too much spicy food and this was the perfect balance so don't be scared to try it :)",2/3/2017,5 star rating

The appetizer was a plate of 4 small pieces: beef, tuna, scallop, and salmon. All of them were delectable. For the second course, we had a choice of roast beef or grilled fish. I had the beef even though Miku is a seafood restaurant since I've never been a fan of grilled fish. It was good, big portion; filled me up quite a bit. Then came the sushi. OMG the salmon ones were melt in your mouth type. So buttery, so heavenly. Finally dessert: panna cotta and sherbet. It was very nicely plated. Miku has a view of the harbour. Very nice if you're into that. The server told us Miku is opening a location in Toronto, I hope sooner than later! All in all, I think the meal plus tax and tip came to $80-90.

790,Lee M.,"Oakville, ON",We find ourselves on a Thursday Night at one of the busiest sushi restaurants in Vancouver.  It's a large place with a great view of the water if you get to snag one of those tables.We ordered seaweed salad and beef carpaccio to start and the salmon oisi roll because everyone seems to recommend it along with a half and half order of miku roll and sunrise roll.  I admit I was a sceptic about aburi sushi but one bite of the salmon oisi made me a believer.  The flame gives the fish a nice smokey flavour not to mention the rice is cooked perfectly.  Perfectly!!  We ordered green tea opera and matcha green tea and pistachio cherry ice cream for dessert.  All the food was fresh and excellent.Service is prompt and efficient which can feel a bit snobbish if you're overly sensitive to that stuff.  I personally found our server very attentive and willing to make recommendations.  He always refilled our tea and water and even bought over some sample sake to try.  The ambiance is chic and noisy  as conversations bounce off all the surfaces and surround you.Can't wait to try the Toronto location that just opened.  After this experience it may be a hard act to follow!!,10/15/2015,5 star rating

There might be some sticker shock but it's worth it. The premium sushi lunch set was my favorite...12pcs of chef's selection nigiri sushi. The hotate (scallop) was fat and juicy but could have used more wasabi inside. Also found the sockeye salmon oshi sushi unique with a middle layer of salmon and the jalapeno pepper is just the right kick. Can't be a picky eater if you're coming here.

Onto the food..Raw Oysters: Pretty decent oysters, but nothing to rave about.Premium Aburi Nigiri: My favorite out of everything we had. It was an assortment of nigiri that were uniquely seasoned and lightly seared. The waitress explained each piece specifically, but unfortunately, I forgot the details. Some notable pieces were salmon, tuna, scallop, yellowtail, and shrimp. Salmon Oshi Roll: Delicious. Seared salmon with a spicy kick from the jalapeno. Red Wave Roll: Again.. delicious. Crab. Avocado. Tuna. And a sauce that was hella interesting but a perfect complement.Miku Roll: A bit underwhelming. Wish there was more uni. Green Tea Opera (dessert): AMAZING. The cake was soft and crispy, a great combo. And the matcha ice cream complemented perfectly.Would definitely come back next time I'm in Vancouver.",2/9/2015,4 star rating
797,Ro S.,"Danville, United States","What a great find. If your love Japanese cuisine I doubt you can find any better in Canada. All the dishes are well thought out. Every little garnish on the plate is there for a reason. Every bite has aroma, texture and taste. The fish is very fresh. Some of the best Uni I have ever tasted and I use to dive for Uni in Northern California. The desserts are just fantastic. I'm still full from the meal and I'm already salivating thinking about what I ate earlier.",9/8/2019,5 star rating
798,Elaine P.,"Lee, United States","A destination restaurant.  Unusual, exceptional sushi.  Everything is great.  The traditional sushi are mouth watering, but the specialty rolls are far better.  We made the mistake of over-ordering (and prices are not inexpensive).  The specialty sushi are quite large and beautifully presented, so order accordingly.",9/7/2019,5 star rating

800,Violet H.,"Dallas, United States","I wish I could say that my company was as good as the food, but I had dinner with the most arrogant jerk ever with my friend, so my rating is just going to be focused on the food and service, however I will share my experience. My friend and I wanted to eat here, and we were not able to eat here because of lack of reservations. Long story short, we met someone who invited us to eat at Miku...That person seemed normal initially but ended up being incredibly rude, self centered, and arrogant, and treated the workers like slaves. Much respect to our server, I believe his name was Leon for being such a champ through the entire experience. He was respectful, polite, and very hardworking.I ordered the Miso baked Sablefish which I thought was good, but it lacked a unique flavor. I could eat the same thing elsewhere, I wish it was more distinctive and flavorful. My dish was also room temperature when it came out which wasn't as satisfying as if it was warm. I did however enjoy the Premium Aburi Nigiri. It was some of the freshest fish I've ever eaten. Absolutely incredible, flavorful, and it did not need any sauce whatsoever. My friend ordered the Miku Roll which was okay, and also the lobster tail I believe which she said was really good. The calamari was on a whole different level. It was so tasty, and I wasn't expecting it to be so good for such a simple dish. I also tried their house soda/sparkling water. I am indifferent to sparkling water, but their sparkling water was actually pretty good. (I know it sounds strange, but it actually tasted different). It seriously just sucks that the person we ate with could only talk about himself for the entire 2 hours that we were there, talk poorly about the staff forgetting our miso soup (which was tasty by the way) and he was a complete creep. I appreciate our server for being very quick as we notified him about the situation and checking on us when we were leaving the restaurant (and trying to stay away from that person) that we were safe. I would highly recommend the nigiri when you come, and the calimari. Overall I would definitely want to eat here again on a special occasion.",3/6/2017,4 star rating
801,Yarden C.,"Sacramento, United States",Not too many vegetarian options but my sisters ate the specials and they couldn't get enough of it. They said it is by far the best sushi they ever had. The sounds they made while eating made me envious lol,9/18/2018,5 star rating
802,Sophie K.,"Toronto, ON","5stars for both the service and the food! During lunch time and weekends, it is always packed (for a good reason!), so do make a reservation! I was lucky enough to get seated at the bar right away because I was alone. I first ordered some green tea, an order of the hamachi sashimi, and the miku zen which consist of individual portions of 4 of their most popular appetizers and an assortment of 5 pieces of sushi. The food quickly arrived and their presentation was very nice. The appetizers were succulent and the sashimi very fresh! The sushi was very good too, but my favourite has to be the Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi, it is a must try!! Obviously I wasn't going to leave before trying their famous Green Tea Opera hihihi Once again I loved their presentation and the taste did not disappoint. I can definitely say that my palate and belly were happy from appetizers to dessert! Throughout my meal, even though I was having lunch alone, I did not feel lonely or awkward. The bartender would every so often make light conversation, refill my cup of green tea, and the waiter would make sure that I was satisfied with the different courses. At the beginning as I was ordering, I mentioned to the waiter that I have a shrimp allergy. He told me that he would make sure that the chefs know about it. Not long after he left, Miku's manager personally came to greet me and made sure I was aware that they will take all the precautions for my shrimp allergy. Talk about good customer service, I was definitely impressed! I will definitely be back whenever I have a layover in Vancouver!",3/12/2016,5 star rating
803,Sicong Z.,"Windsor, ON","Sushi and sashimi are super fresh and tasty. Love the salad, the sauce is sweet and salty.

804,Mike C.,"North Vancouver, BC","The much hyped aburi sushi is made up of remarkably thin piece of sashimi on top of a densely compacted cube of rice, gotta admire the knife skill.  If I havent tried better I would've thought this is what aburi sushi is really like.  Price wise it's not way up there but it's not cheap either,  for the money I suggest go get some real sushi instead.  Granted the items we ordered tasted decent and some actually quite good, however just not feeling satisfied after the meal, and the portions were all very small,  4 of us spent over $300 ( did not order any alcohol/drinks) and I was still hungry after the meal, went had a bowl of ramen afterward.Also, it was a Saturday night I guess they were hoping we could leave asap so they come and collected the plates as soon as we finish one, the feeling of being rushed is unpleasant.  Wondering why so many good reviews ?",1/20/2017,1 star rating

806,Danielle C.,"Vancouver, BC","We had planned for oysters so we tried their Oysters on the Half Shell. These are their daily oysters so they vary from time to time and are priced at market price (MP). The ones we got were from the East Coast and were $24. You get 6 oysters with 3 different sauces on the side: wasabi chimichurri, lime leaf mignonette, and ginger cocktail sauce. The wasabi chimichurri was one of the more unique sauces that I've tried. We weren't expecting them to be so small for their price, but they were very fresh and delicious with the sauces. I also wasn't worried about getting sick from eating these raw oysters since they're from a restaurant that I trust.We were then served with some complimentary samplers. It was some sort of creamy vegetable(?) puree with crab meat and tobiko. It was a nice addition to our meal and they were presented so nicely!Miku is known for their aburi oshi sushi, which is box-shaped sushi that's been lightly flame-seared. I order this every time I go here- it's simply amazing. They have 3 kinds: the Salmon Oshi Sushi ($17), Ebi Oshi Sushi ($16.50), and Saba Oshi Sushi ($16). We ordered one full order of the salmon (6pc) and half of the ebi and saba (3pc each). I remember liking the ebi the best before but this time, the salmon was the clear winner with its delicious special sauce and jalapeño on top. All of them were delicious though. This is a must try if you ever visit Miku!Because it's cherry blossom season, they had a separate Sakura Feature menu that's available until April 14. CC and I ended up ordering the Sakura Roll ($19), which is on this special menu. These were so pretty! It was scallop, asparagus, and sockeye salmon wrapped with hamachi then topped with shiso leaf, golden tobiko, pickled wasabi, and a salted sakura flower. Again, this was well worth it. It was a very interesting roll and there was a good balance of flavours as well as textures. The saltiness of the sakura flower complemented the acidity of the pickled wasabi and the umami of the fish. The asparagus gave a nice, contrasting crunch as well. I thought it was a really well done and creative roll and I'm glad we were able to try it.The aburi oshi sushi is a must and the Miku Zen is a good choice for lunch.Food - 9.5/10Service - 9/10Ambience - 10/10Value - 7/10",4/11/2017,5 star rating
807,Cam M.,"North Vancouver, BC","Miku is a great weeknight sushi spot. Inexpensive and quick sushi, average service, wide menu selection. We're guests here around once a week and generally have good meals. The rolls are fresh and generous portion, their noodles and salads are decent. A few of the side dishes like grilled prawns have been really hit or miss, so I'd recommend sticking to the more basic staple sushi items here. Great for take away and open late too.",1/15/2019,3 star rating
808,Ryan S.,"Brooklyn, United States","It seems to be more hype than quality.  We had some really great appetizers, but the main attraction--Aburi--was pretty awful.  (The nigiri was nothing special either.)  The service was lousy as well. A good piece of toro should bring one closer to God, but mine was so dry and bland that I had to be reminded that it was, in fact, toro.  It just as easily could have passed for boiled chicken. After a couple of dry and unappetizing pieces of the Aburi, I had to ask our waiter for soy sauce, which he evidently didn't appreciate.  His response: ""You shouldn't need it."" Need is relative, but if I'm asking for it, could you just kindly deliver it without judgment or comment?  When he finally delivered it, I explained that I wanted the soy sauce because the first couple of pieces were dry and flavorless, to which he stupidly and dismissively replied ""well, it's an option.""  You could swing a short rope and hit a handful of really great Japanese restaurants in Vancouver.  This just isn't one of them, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it.",9/8/2018,2 star rating

Little did we know!First off, service was incredible. I don't know our waitresses name, but she was friendly, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable. I have a severe sesame allergy and my friend couldn't eat wheat (keeping Passover) and our waitress made sure we felt comfortable and informed, handling our restrictions with pizazz. The manager even came over to ensure everything was ok - appreciate it!The food - I'm drooling writing this. Obviously the specialty sushi, words can't describe, you have to try it. The mackerel was my favorite, melt in your mouth delicious. However, the real show stopper was the SCALLOPS. Do yourself a favor and get those. Perfectly seared scallops with indian inspired flare, including a hefty portion of cumin roasted Brussels with bacon. After the first bite my friend and I just gaped at each other in amazement at how delicious it was.

The Aburi Beef Carpaccio was very tasty and highly recommended. Soba perperoncino is also very good. The prime rib is also cooked in a Japanese style and is quite nice. The Ebi Oshi Sushi was delicious as well, but have to admit I was not a fan of the Salmon Oshi Sushi - would probably avoid both in the future and go with traditional sushi or sashimi.

Try to request to get seated by the window that looks out to Canada place - the view is stunning.I come here mainly for their salmon aburi sushi. Do not be tricked by how simple it looks, it is very flavorful. I've tried a lot of other aburis at other sushi place, and not one has made a salmon aburi as good as Miku's. I also really enjoyed their tofu salad. It does come in quite a large portion so it may be a good idea to share this. They also have the best desserts. The last time I went I had the green tea and chocolate opera cake - I never had such a delectable green tea cake. Other than these I thought their other entree items were just average. Otherwise, the service and ambience in the restaurant is great. It is clean, quiet and the perfect place to enjoy great aburi sushi.",7/20/2015,3 star rating

820,Quan Z.,"San Jose, United States","Came here last year on a friend's recommendation that Vancouver has awesome seafood and super fresh sushi. Got the kaiso seaweed salad, Miku signature selection, and the green tea opera. All three were hella delicious.Salad is decent (for salad, the only purpose of which is to cleanse your palate so you can enjoy more meat); it's Asian salad so there's like lotus root and sesame and actual light flavoring that goes in the dressing. The signature is a kind of sampler of their sushi, you get some traditional raw nigiri, some of their own creation, and some of this thing called ""aburi"" where they lightly sear part of the fish that goes on the sushi, imparting a unique flavor profile on it. That green tea opera really hit the spot afterwards though. Matcha is one of my favorite flavorings for desserts, and the cake part of it had that perfect blend of moist and crumbly, with the wafer in the center providing excellent texture to contrast with the cake bits.Also got the sake flight and now I really want some Hakkaisan.",1/8/2015,5 star rating

The Zen is a great lunch option because it gives you a well rounded meal with appetizers and sushi. What I really like about Miku is the freshness in their fish and how flavorful they make all their food - it's like a flavor explosion (or melt in many cases) in your mouth!Service was great as always, our server was really friendly and attentive and made great recommendations, kudos!

822,Mia L.,"Miami, United States","Really delicious meal in Vancouver. The wait was crazyyyy long(1.5 hours) but luckily we were staying across the street and they offered to call us when our table was ready. The service was honestly incredible. Once seated, the manager came over and apologized for the long wait and introduced us to the menu items. She asked if we had any allergies present(which we did) and she encouraged us that the food does not come in contact with any peanut products but to stay away from some of the dessert items. Whenever any food item was brought to the table, the would explain what everything was. The mussels were delicious and my Salmon Oshi Sushi Aburi was delicious. The best thing, though, was by far the dessert, the Green Tea Opera cake(does contain hazelnut so had to stay away from my brother after eating). Oh my gosh it was amazing. Our waitress explained that it takes three whole days to make! It had a unique little fruit on top as well called a Gooseberry which was also yummy. Really enjoyed the experience here.",3/11/2018,5 star rating
823,Jen L.,"Seattle, United States","Amazing! It's modernized and with touches of ethnic fusion rather than strict traditional japanese. Good to know before you come. We did the omakase which is $80 pp. Well worth it! 7 courses and I only wish we had more room for dessert. 1) Cucumber sushi with cucumber replacing the role of rice. Fresh and crisp. 2) Sashimi platter with 6 pieces, so fresh and delicious. 3) 4 item Bento box of tofu salad, 1 giant prawn, 2 raw oysters, and chicken with a tartar and coeslaw. The oysters were great, but one had a chutney of green stuff that over powered the delicate oyster. Eat the fried chicken firat as the breading gets soggy if you wait too long. 4) Sable fish,  I would have liked a crispy skin on it. The broth was phenomenal, poured over the foam and fish. 5) filet mignon (small slices) I think on the rare side, wi th mashed potato and grilled veggies. I got 3 large scallops instead of red meat. They were perfectly seared and seasoned. Delicious. 6) 6 piece sushi/nigiri/oshi platter. Yes, as with previous reviews the samosa oshi is great. 7) green tea opera. I love the wafer crunch of the bottom. Well balanced and doesnt have too grassy of a flavor from the green tea that usually turns me off. The service was slower, but top notch. Thomas was our waiter. The manager came around after a few minutes to welcome us and explain the menu and restaurant concept. It was a really nice touch. We had a gorgeous waterfront view by the window. Sake flight was additional $25 pp. My friends who got it said it was worth it. I must come back! I think I'd do the omakase again!",12/22/2014,5 star rating

My boyfriend and I went for my birthday celebration, but the experience was bad.We were seated at the bar, where servers and bartenders are constantly there, yet we had to wait more than 30 min to be approached to order. There was one bartender that seems to be serving our side of the bar; however, he would somehow not talk to us at all even when I was trying to get his attention - to the point where I thought I must be invisible to him - because he was literally chatting with a gentleman next to us when I said ""excuse me"" several times.Food was generally okay. But O-toro was out for the day so we ordered Bincho toro instead as recommended by the server. However, Bincho toro had very strong fishy smell (i love seafood, but this one was too strong).

Sake was delicious and did complement the courses very well. We had the chance to sit right in front of the kitchen and it was mesmerizing watching everyone work! Very impressive and made the experience so much better! The only comment I would make, is that we mentioned it was our last night in town plus the last night of our honeymoon and no one brought it up. We were in some other smaller restaurants around the area and they took the time to write congrats on the bill, or the manager came to say hi or another place even offered us a little treat...doesn't have to be much but it should have definitely be acknowledged.",7/10/2018,5 star rating

844,Hana A.,"Los Angeles, United States","This restaurant was such a great experience, from the service to the food! I'm so glad this was our last foodie stop... Such a delightful end of our travel. They make their own sparkling water and donate a part of the proceeds. And the best part is it's only two dollars! We both ordered the Miku Zen, which came with miso soup, four small dishes, and five pieces of sushi. Quinoa salad with shrimp- shrimp is perfectly cooked and dressing was amazing. A light, tangy dish that stimulated my appetite.Hamachi sashimi- with grated carrots. Perfectly cut.Ebi fritter- most restaurants go heavy on the aoili and batter but Miku does it right. So crispy.Sable fish- in a soy creamy glaze. Fluffy with baby book choy.All of the sushi was amazing, but the stand out was the salmon oishi roll. Lightly seared on top it was so buttery and melted in my mouth. Natalie was out waitress and she was charming and excellent without being pretentious. Loved the experience.

847,Young J.,"Vancouver, BC","I usually don't order cocktails as it is pretty hard to find a good cocktail in restaurants in Vancouver. Shame! Shame! The audacity some bar tenders have in Vancouver to keep their jobs with these low quality booze! Don't even get me started on that topic.Miku, on the other hand, ended up making us order the same cocktail three times. ROSEMARY GIMLET! Soooo delicious!It was last April or May that we had a fun night at Miku with a beautiful view of north shore.As much as I love Toshi, I should just admit that Miku is the best for sushi in Vancouver. (Sorry Toshi, I still love you.) Miku's aburi is fabulous. Six of us ordered whole variety of rolls, oshi sushi, nigiri and sashimi (mostly binco, binco toro and maguro) and they were all fresh and delicious in full of flavour, NOT from the sauce but from the freshness of the ingredient.It costs an arm and leg but it was worth it :)Oh be careful if you are to wear a black dress.

850,Natasha S.,"Vancouver, BC","I visited Miku twice. Once for dinner and once for Lunch. Both meals, I opted for the Kaiseki sets that offered a good variety of the Miku showcased. The food was delicious. Very intricately put together and paired, a must try for someone new to japanese cuisine. However the 42$ and 88$ (before tax and tip) price tag means i'm looking for a dining experience that not only provided great food, ambiance but also great service. What was not acceptable was how inattentive my server was. It took 20 min for him to notice that we had finished our main course as our empty plates sat awkwardly in front of us, and another 10 min for dessert to come. Not only that, he did not bring any soysauce for the sushi, and still didn't bring it despite me asking for it. Our waters were not filled, and all i saw him do was chatting at the water station with other girl servers. I had been so excited to bring my mother here we left disappointed. No matter how good the food was, if the service was lacking, it just ruined the whole meal. Perhaps I was unlucky and got placed with a server who looked like he didn't want to be there working. Maybe i'll give them a chance again sometime in the future.",9/1/2017,3 star rating
851,Arthur H.,"Vancouver, BC","I wanted to go to Miku for years and finally got the chance to go! I made reservations about 2 weeks prior and requested seats: by the window with an ocean view. Service was on point from start to finish.Salmon Oshi Sushi: A. This was probably my favourite. It just melts in your mouth. Many say that some sushi restaurants offer similar aburi quality for lower prices, i.e. Victoria Sushi in New West, I disagree... Miku is something else.Coal Harbour Platter: B-. The platter was good, but did not amaze. The oysters and mussels were kinda small. I was more excited about the three sides that came with it. For $33 I definitely expected more.Aburi Chirashi Tart: A. This tart came out way bigger than I expected. Not only was it presented nicely, but it also tasted amazing. The layers looked really neat!Overall, it was a great lunch. Next time, I will stick with fish and skip the other seafood.",10/11/2017,5 star rating
852,Arleen C.,"Vancouver, BC","My friends rave about this place all the time. They have even called it  their favorite Japanese restaurant in town *GASPS*. I think that's a bold statement to make when there's so much competition and so many taste buds around, but I was willing to give it a go. Appearance wise, it felt like a Caucasian/Western restaurant. Not Western like we're at the rodeo and ordering some rocky mountain oysters, but Western as in...okay fine, not Japanese. It had no Japanese feel at all. If you didn't see the name of the place or know the food, it'd look like a fancy schmancy restaurant. I'll break down the food because I'm picky and weird:- Aburi beef carpaccio was nothing to write home about. In fact, don't bother. Yeah it might be tempting because the description just sounded so fantastic. Don't. Do. It. It was flavorless. Also, where the hell was the aburi? - The kale goma-ae was yummy. It tasted like every other gomae I've eaten...except it was kale. - Miku waterfront platter was beautiful and well priced considering how much food you got. It said it serves three but please keep in mind it meant as an appetizer and NOT an entree. Also, I love the oyster's nectar, so to stand it up on its vertical side was wrong. Wrong, Wrong. Wrong. It left the oysters sitting there without any of its natural, sweet liquid. The mussels were also tiny because it's not in season or something, so that was disappointing. The sashimi cuts were also very thin, more so than usual. The scallop ceviche was left too long as they had completely discolored from what ceviche should normally look like. Someone left their ceviche in fluids too long. The poke was good except the thinly cut pieces of fish were a bit odd. I'm used to poke in cubes so to find leftover strange long and narrow cuts to be different. The jumbo shrimp were great but I'm fairly certain no one goes to a Japanese restaurant to get a prawn cocktail. - The saba oshi sushi was delicious. Was it worth $16? Hell no. Honestly some of their sauces on the sushi (they'd prefer you not bastardize it by drowning it in sauce so many of the nigiri are pre-sauced) were delicious, especially the botan ebi (amaebi). The other stuff was pretty lackluster. Their tamari sauce was  yummy though. If I was trying to impress someone with the presentation, view and a twist on traditional Japanese food, sure I'd come here. But would I crave this as much as I crave my other two favorite sushi places in town? Nope. I can get fresher sushi elsewhere, and for less. The amount we paid was outrageous considering the amount of food we received. The amount we paid could have easily fed more people at my other favorite sushi restaurants. It was definitely worth trying just to tick it off the list so I can actually have an opinion when I hear people rave about it. Will I be hopping on the bandwagon? No thanks. I can see why people would like this to ""wow"" someone or on a special occasion or something, but it's just not up my alley as a ""go to"" when I'm craving Japanese food.",4/10/2015,3 star rating
853,Kenneth Y.,"Irvine, United States","I made a 9:30 pm reservation to make this the first stop on my trip to Vancouver and was looking forward to trying the Kaiseki menu. However, when I arrived for my reservation and seated, I was informed that the chef's menu was not available late in the evening. The website and menu do not provide this information and, had I been aware, I would've made an earlier reservation.Quite the disappointment.",9/27/2016,1 star rating
854,Shirley L.,"Toronto, ON","I've been to the Miku in Toronto a couple of times, but obviously I wanted to give the original location a try, especially because I heard the food here is better, the fish is fresher, etc. etc. Despite the myriad of sushi and aburi sushi places in Vancouver, this place is still super high in demand - I ended up having dinner at 9:30 PM on a Monday night because they only had super late time slots available for the next 3 or 4 nights. I did have an overall good experience here, and I really can't complain about the food or the service. I just think that my expectations might have been too high. The menu was, for the most part, identical to the one in Toronto, with a few very minor differences. For table of 3, we got the hokkaido scallop sashimi (6 pcs), a roll (I think it was the Miku Roll), the premium aburi nigiri, and the aburi lobster tail (unique to Vancouver, this is not on the Toronto menu.) I'm not going to go into too much detail, because as I expected, everything was delicious, and everything was fresh. But I mean, aburi sushi in general is delicious, and I think for some reason I was just expecting to be blown out of the water by the Vancouver location in particular. I did really enjoy the aburi lobster tail, which came with some well-seasoned couscous. Other than that, it was the exact same as the Toronto location. If anything, I actually like the ambiance at the Toronto location better, because it's brighter and more pleasant to me, whereas this one is just incredibly dim, like too much so. For one, it makes it difficult to take good pictures of your food, and it's also just wholly unnecessary to dim the lights to this level.Having tried their green tea opera cake before, we opted for the lemon blueberry dome this time, and while it was tasty and refreshing with lots of fruity and tropical flavours, for $13 it wasn't anything special. Not trying to hate on this restaurant, the food here is obviously good, I'm not denying that, and despite the fact that it's expensive, I will say it's worth it because it's an experience coming here. But I'm not going to hide the fact that I personally was expecting a bit more, coming from  a different city with a different perspective, and my expectations weren't completely met.",9/23/2016,3 star rating

(Mind you, we came to Vancouver specifically to eat... everything) MUST ORDERS: **Saba Oshi Sushi - the aburi sushi is pressed as opposed to rolledin sushi paper**Green Tea Opera (Dessert) - you won't be disappointedYou can also order any 8 piece roll and have them do a split (4 of one kind and 4 of another). We split the Sunset and the Miku Roll.As an entree I had the Kaisen Soba Peperoncino, which were noodles with a bunch of seafood and the perfect kick of spice (if you don't like spicy food, I'm not sure I would recommend this dish). My boyfriend ordered the Saikyo Miso Baked Sablefish. ... if you follow any other of my posts, you'll see how much I rant and rave over the sablefish at Blue Water Cafe. Don't get me wrong, I still stand by my post on Blue Water Cafe, BUT I think it's safe to say I'd be pulling a Kanye on my own speech, ""Blue Water Cafe, I'ma let you finish... but Miku has the best sable fish of all time!""

858,Robyn S.,"Vancouver, BC","Miku specializes in Aburi Sushi and presents a robust menu to allow diners to try a variety of new flavours. We started our meal with the beef carpaccio appetizer served with a 64 degree egg in the middle. It was a very generous serving with plenty for both of us. To get a taste of all that was offered we ordered the Miku Signature Selection sushi plater ($36) which offers three pieces traditional nigiri, two pieces Oshi Sushi, two pieces of specialty rolls, and three pieces aburi nigiri. Next we ordered a half orders of Salmon Oshi Sushi, Saba Oshi Sushi, and Red Wave Roll. We then had the Premium Aburi Sushi plater ($26) which came with 8 different nigiri - the Bincho Toro was a clear favourite! We really enjoyed a lot of what we had and even the pieces that weren't our favourite could be admired for their interesting flavour combinations. We finished off with a scoop of Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream served with fruit and chocolate for me and the Green Tea Opera for my partner. They were both delicious and perfect sizes to cap off the night. Overall, the food was delicious but the service left something to be desired.",11/20/2016,4 star rating

Lenny jumped in a bit towards the end and helped out with dessert and helped suggest other places for us to go while in Vancouver which was so above and beyond what he needed to do.

As we came to Miku after walking twenty minutes in the rain, we decided to treat ourselves to the Sakura Kaiseki. Best decision ever! The entire meal was beautiful, literally. It comes served in beautiful porcelain pottery that looks like a huge circular globe. It comes in three parts. The first course was a semi-salty egg custard with lobster, I believe and a bit of roe. Then there was the glazed monkfish, I believe, a selection of sashimi, and then a plate of different sushi. The wagyu was a bit too chewy for me. We were seated in this private booth across from the large window showing the Vancouver waterfront. It was a great dinner to our Vancouver trip.

871,joe z.,"Salt Lake City, United States","We went to Miiku our first night during our first ever visit to Vancouver. I hope I don't sound like a sushi snob, but I believe my experience is an important context in the review. I have had sushi in some of the most critically reviewed and widely accepted sushi restaurants - Nobu (the first one in NYC), Sushiran (San Francisco), Morimoto (Philly) to name some of the highlights. I've lived in Japan long enough to be semi fluent in Japanese. I've eaten sushi on the premises of the Tsukiji fish market - the largest fish market in the world and every place in between. I have truly had some of the best sushi available. I give Miiku 5 stars. The red wave roll was like eating euphoria - seriously. While all of the sushi is available in the traditional nigiri style, I really enjoy seeing what the most gifted chefs can do with the simplicity and elegance of the most perfect meal. And Miiku blew me away. The service was great. We are outside, overlooking the harbor. We sampled only 25% of the menu but what we had was superb - all leading up to the finale - the red wave.  You must try it. They also have their own pastry chef who makes very imaginative, visually stunning yet very subtle and tasty desserts. I hated putting a spoon in the art on the plate - but after several pictures - I had to. Soooooo tasty. Sorry so long winded. This place is awesome.

Coal Harbour Platter - This amazing basket of goodies features fresh prawns, oysters, mussels, and clams. It comes with yummy sides such as poke, ceviche, and kale goma-ae! Be sure to check with your server to see if they have the Fanny Bay oysters as it is relatively sweet and doesn't have too much of a brine aftertaste. 3. Saba Oshi Sushi - The oshi sushi makes a second appearance! (**Hint hint, you better make sure you try it) This dish is a cured mackerel pressed sushi with a savoury miso sauce! This dish is lighter in taste than the salmon variant, but just as addicting! The miso sauce is to die for!Book in advance as the place is always packed with people throughout the day!

878,Anton H.,"Seattle, United States","Excellent sushi. I was impressed with the sushi overall. I've never had aburi style sushi before and came here specifically for that reason. The technique they use to sear the sushi imparts a slightly smoky flavor to it that really works well with the fish. The aburi style sushi is what they call pressed sushi. They literally stuff the sushi and rice into a special box that allows them to press it together and form a large rectangle which they then cut into smaller rectangles for consuming. It's topped with their secret sauce which is tasty. The pressed sushi (salmon) is pretty oily but not so much that it was a turn off. The two specialty rolls (King roll and red wave roll) we tried were also good as was their tempura fried shrimp (ebi fritter). They allow you to get half rolls so you can try multiple ones. They were out of oysters when we were there so I didn't get a chance to try them. This place is pretty spendy for a sushi place, comparable to Umi in Seattle. It's worth trying at least once though. FYI, between 2 and 5 they only serve what they call ""bar bites"" or something like that, because the kitchen is changing over for the dinner service.t",2/23/2017,4 star rating

This was some of the best sushi I've ever had. It was very interesting that you're not even supposed to dip the sushi in soy sauce. The sushi chef basically brushes the sushi with a little soy sauce before they bring it to you. That way you can really enjoy the full flavors of all the different fish and shrimp and scallops they give you.

The meal started off with a egg/tofu custard with lobster and ikura which was a bit salty and tasted a lot like the ocean. It was good but not my favourite. The second course was a set of 3 dishes served together. We had fresh sashimi, aburi beef carpaccio and miso baked sablefish. The sablefish was the highlight and was amazing and the sashimi was super sweet and fresh. I would definitely recommend ordering the sablefish though (personal preference). The 3rd courses was a plate of selected nigiri. These were absolutely amazing! The flavour and taste is almost indescribable but every piece was amazing and so much care was put into it. Just amazing sushi, great atmosphere and great service. Never fails to impress me and I leave super satisfied every time. The desert was also very good.

I took my friend here for her birthday and not only did they provide me with a candle on a dessert, they kindly even took it off the bill.

894,Elliot B.,"Seattle, United States","Don't usually write reviews but...I've eaten great sushi in Seattle and tokyo. And bad sushi in other parts of the US.  I generally don't like messing with sushi.  I don't like gimmicky rolls or god-aweful cooked sushi I have seen crop up in the US.For this visit to miku it was my 13th wedding anniversary and I knew they did some weird ""aburi"" type thing but they had regular sushi, good reviews, and I wanted a view so I booked it.My expectations were greatly exceeded!!We were taken to a 4 person table with the best view.  Treated to 5 star attentive pour your sake for you service. Which by itself would have been a great experience.  But what happened was far better than I ever anticipated!For starters, I was told that sushi would be served without extra wasabi and soy sauce. Something I commended but also didn't want to leave to the chef so I made my request known that I need some on the side despite the classical rudeness.Then what happened was crazy.  The server said no problem"" returned with our huge assortement (i got chefs choice) sushi as well as soy sauce in two sections of a single dish one for sweet and one for normal. The fact that they knew the difference was nice but not really amazing.  But what happened next made the deal.  I looked down and noticed that my nigiri had been lightly brushed in soy sauce.  I took a bite and noticed a decent wasabi kick which felt appropriate.  Immediately I had an amazing experience - I didn't need soy sauce or extra wasabi it was done already and evenly in a way no person can dip for themselves.Look I'm know hiro art of sushi level gourmet but this was outside the Japanese tradition but very much within the Japanese ideal of delivering a perfect piece not needing something else.Then I wolfed it down immaturely. it was perfect and I couldn't stop...Then I came across it.  That aberration: aburi: slightly seered sushi.  It was in appearance perfect. Rectangular salmon on top and salmon inside but otherwise as a perfect sized bite of nigiri. It had a cute piece of jalapeno to add to the ridiculous experience. So inhaled like with the rest then boom:Wtf: salmon butter?  What is this? There is no such thing.  Yummy sushi rice, good salmon, no soy needed..  What is happening?  This is supposed to be a vain attempt at perfecting sushi..So I turn to my far more exacting wife ( who is only eating yellow tail sashimi and savoring the singular fish) and say ""you have to try this but it's gone.""I look up expecting to do my Seattle thing of being obvious and hoping my server takes notice and instead she and her assistant are across the room, actively make eye contact and hurry over eager to please.  I explain that she should have told me the nigiri was perfect and brushed with soy sauce but more importantly that I needed more salmon aburi.  I orders two servings.Shortly they appear and I offer my wife her first piece.  (Mind you she is allergic to dairy and egg and hasn't had butter in at least 7 years). She ate the piece as was wrecked.  She didn't get it.  She was tasting this perfect sushi but also experiencing the feeling of butter texture she hadn't had in forever.  Butter doesn't describe it.  Not at all.  But I can't explain how different and yet perfectly suited it was to the sushi plate.  We ate it all quickly and pushed our stomach limits...Epilogue:Miku also provided a special surprise dessert with a happy anniversary message to make the day special despite my last minute booking. Turns out the dessert takes 3 days to make and it was amazing.  But I came for sushi, got wrecked with aburi and that life changing Culinary experience had nothing to do with the perfect anniversary experience that was delivered flawlessly.My only regret is that people like me will read this and won't try the aburi because the perfect anniversary dinner compromised an otherwise objective sushi critique.",9/25/2016,5 star rating

Coming from Texas, I'm used to seeing Mexicans as the sushi chefs), the swanky, sophisticated vibe of the restaurant, and the view - OMG the view - you're right at the marina so you have a beautiful backdrop of the bay. This is not one of those western restaurants that try to be Japanese - no, no, no - the food they serve is definitely legit Japanese food with a sophisticated twist. You need to have deep pockets to eat here but i'm a big believer in paying for quality. Order anything and everything. It all tastes great.",9/9/2014,4 star rating
898,Charlotte W.,"Toronto, ON","WOW!Really understand the hype of Miku - but the food is really good.Last minute reservations for 3 on a Friday night meant that there was no availability until 9, but since it was summer in Vancouver, it was still so bright outside.When you walk in, you are greeted by a person who asks if you have reservations. The place was packed!We were so lucky to get a booth seating with a view and that's when I knew it was going to be a good night.Yes, we tried the Aburi sashimi which was buttery soft. We also ordered sashimi for 3 and it was fresh as can be. That, with a good bottle of Sake made Miku really memorable.Service was excellent. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is a big fan of sushi. Hoping the one in Toronto is as good and can't wait to try and see!Great for romantic dates, big group gatherings, special occasions, and everything in between!",7/22/2016,5 star rating
899,Jessica L.,"Vancouver, BC","Quite simply, some of tastiest food I've ever had. Arguable one of the best places to get good quality sushi. I've never had a bad experience here. Everyone knows their aburi sushi is amazing. The salmon is delicious but our favourite has always been the ebi. Something about the melt in your mouth ebi with fresh lime zest... Man I dream about this dish. We get the soba pecorino often as well as its delicious with nice morsels of seafood throughout. It's higher priced but worth every penny. I can't say enough good things about Miku. It's definitely a place everyone needs to try at least once.",6/24/2016,5 star rating
900,Sandeep M.,"New York, United States","The positives - excellent service, great ambience, loved the dessert.  First time eating aburi sushi and it was a mixed bag.  The sauces sometimes masked the fish (the buttery taste of the salmon was primarily due to the aoili) but the mackerel did shine through.  Also, they press the fish and that can mess the texture.Would have given it a 3.5 if that was an option but the service and rest of the food pushes it towards a 4 and not a 3.",8/25/2018,4 star rating
901,Stephanie R.,"Seattle, United States","Order the aburi style salmon roll and you won't regret it. I crave that roll now constantly - the mix of the sauce, the soft, creamy rice and the seared buttery salmon combo is unbelievable. The rest of the rolls were good, but this roll is like no other. If I came back, I would order 3 aburi style salmon rolls and call it a day.",3/1/2017,4 star rating
902,T C.,"San Francisco, United States","Lovely decor and amazing views! Nice variety in dishes but we find it to be hit or miss on some things. Most of the sushi is very fresh and everything is prepared beautifully but the salmon in particular fell a little flat for us the last time we were there (absolutely great server however!)  The seared sushi pieces were also done well and the ones with mayo warms up amazingly tasty which made us happy. We also had the seasonal menu which was presented well and tasty but not particularly memorable. The best deal, we thought, was the ice cream for under $4 :DA place we would return to if we were in the area and craving good food with a view but I think Oshima in California remains our favorite for ""Aburi""style sushi.",6/3/2015,4 star rating

904,Audrey L.,"Toronto, ON","Don't let appearances fool you here, friends: waterfront view, modern decor and an open sushi bar so you can see all the fancy methods the chefs have up their sleeves; it's all a delightful show that, sadly, didn't translate to the food. To be fair, 2 orders of rolls does not a complete review make. However, both were enough to leave me feeling unsatisfied.My date & I, still full from an earlier meal, ordered the Oshi Salmon Sushi (as per everyone's reviews) & the Crunchy Surf & Turf Roll. The Oshi Salmon sushi is the clear favourite here, as theyve got boxes of them behind the counter partially prepared, waiting to be blowtorched. And it was good... But I dont know if it was good on its own, or because we were so disappointed in the other roll that the Oshi was good only in comparison.The Crunchy Surf & Turf roll was a HUGE disappointment. It was so bland and boring, I may as well have been eating plain sushi rice, that had a bit of crunchy tempura batter sprinkled on it. We hinted our disappointment to our server, who didnt seem incredibly interested in our dissatisfaction. Dont know if Id come back here, there's definitely better sushi to be had elsewhere, especially in Vancouver.",7/11/2014,2 star rating

906,MF U.,"La Jolla, United States","Got the chef's tasting menu and everything was really really good up to the sushi course. Loved the course served in the Death Star. sushi course at the end was a little disappointing. The fish was sliced thinner than a piece of soy paper roll, The sauce layered on top was too thick and overbearing , and the rice was piled high.  Also wish they would enforce some type of basic dress code.

907,Jeannine N.,"Calgary, AB","I really wanted to like this place after seeing the reviews and based on my friend's recommendation.  I give it three stars for these reasons:1.  It's over rated, and for what you get its not great value.  I got the 10 piece Miku Signature Selection, see picture.  This includes 2 pieces of aburi sushi (company's signature sushi) which basically is box sushi with a thin sliver of fish, topped with seared mayo and its sauce.  Big deal, I've had better boxed sushi in Vegas at a better price than this place if you can believe that.2.  I was still hungry after and so was the person sitting left to me at the sushi bar, for him I can see cause he's a bigger man than me (not by much) but for a 5' Asian woman of skinny build, man I need to eat another 5 pieces at least.  We both agreed for what we got it wasn't the best and both had better elsewhere.  It was his first time there too.  3.  Unlike the guest other guest, I ordered the green opera cake that everyone raves about, and again underwhelmed.  Is very small for $13.50 and if you want a great treat save your money and go to Thierry on Alberni.However I would say it has some good qualities:1.  Service was good 2.  Great location over looking the waterSo if you're looking for good location and service come here but if you're looking for good quality sushi at a fair price that you don't have to take out a loan on your line of credit for, and feel somewhat full, don't come here.  There's other places that offer very good quality sushi at good prices and offer good service. I'm not cheap by any means for if I was, I wouldn't have set foot in this place.  I was expecting to be blown away, and this place didn't do it.",5/31/2016,3 star rating
908,Tracy H.,"Bellevue, United States","From browsing through the pictures I had such high hopes for this restaurant. I ended up leaving disappointed and a lot poorer. First up: nigiri. The market price pieces were very expensive and miniature. The slices of fish were were very thin and small in size. That's a little unusual for an upscale Japanese restaurant. The seafood bouillabaisse was ok, not something I'd miss or order again. I tried one of their special rolls which was anything but special. We waited forever in between dishes, and what's worse is they forgot one of our dishes altogether! To summarize: the food took too long to be prepared/delivered, expensive for small portions, flavors are mediocre at best, and missing order. I can see what attracts people here: location/view, upscale decor, and hip environment, which equates to a desirable date spot or for socialites to hang out. As for foodies like me, I don't think I'll be back.",7/6/2014,3 star rating

913,Briana M.,"Seattle, United States","I feel like this place is way overhyped. We took a last minute trip to Vancouver and therefore hadn't really planned out our meals very much. On the recommendation of several friends we decided to try out Miku. After reading the reviews, we were definitely excited. The concierge at our hotel tried to call them to make a reservation for us, but being a busy Saturday, they decided they didn't need to even answer their phones. Our concierge told us that we might have to wait, but we should be able to sit in the bar. Okay we thought, and hopped in a taxi to head over. The hostesses were cold and abrupt. Once we got seated at the bar, we got settled in. It was very clear that the bartender that was helping us was drunk, ducking behind the bar to take more shots and just kind of floating around looking busy but not really doing much. It was incredibly loud the entire time and our food was just okay. Nothing really to make the experience memorable, especially given how rude and out of it our server was. I won't likely be back based on this.",8/11/2016,2 star rating

The food here was awesome - I wish I could have tried more dishes!As a warning, if you want plain sashimi or sushi, and nothing fancy, then Miku is not the place for you. This is the place you want to go if you want something different. This was my first time having aburi sushi and I wasn't disappointed. The fish is very small relative to the rice, but I love the flavour of the dish. The aburi sushi is topped with a special sauce which complements the fish.

People get tired sometimes and I totally understand and respect those people who provide services. My friends were taught how to use the napkin because I was the only one who made all the talking and my friends were speaking in another language. We've been to so many nice restaurants but never experienced this before. We spoke to the manager when we left. He is very nice and other people working there are very friendly and helpful.

937,Sabrina L.,"Vancouver, BC","Great higher end Japanese restaurant in the city.  Food is good, but in my opinion nothing special, considering the price.I do want to focus on the decor and service here.The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful - looking over Canada Place and the water, there are very few places in the city with this kind of a view.  The modern decor with high ceilings makes the room spacious even when it is packed with people. Service, every visit has been top notch - from the moment you enter and talk to the hostesses to when you leave the door.  All the staff speak great English, and are extremely knowledgeable of the food and drinks, this is not so common for Japanese restaurants, where your server is either unable to understand you, or does not know the answer to your questions.  Top that with good food, and it makes for a great spot for dates or special occasion.  There are copy cat restaurants that are imitating Miku's aburi style sushi, at a significantly discounted price, but Miku is the original, and Miku has the decor, view, and service to go with it.  Best is often imitated and not duplicated, that is clearly the case with the competition.",3/14/2016,4 star rating

Not bad.I also ordered their green tea opera cake because I heard it took them 3 days to make it(wow!).

942,Trina A.,"Coquitlam, BC","This place is amazing. I went twice in one weekend! One time for lunch, the next day for dinner.First of all, the ambiance of the restaurant is lovely. When we had lunch, the sun was out and created amazing natural lighting while we were eating (aka, good lighting for the IG photos). During dinner (if it's not raining), you have a wonderful view of waterfront and Canada Place.But enough of that! Food time!Lunch: Miku Zen Box $28 : this was definitely bang for your buck. Only available during lunch, it's basically their ""bento box"" - but way fancier. It had 5 pieces of their favourite rolls, Aburi sushi (!!!), miso soup and 4 appetizer type items. 5 pieces: 1 from Sunrise Roll, 1 from Red Wave Roll, 1 Toro Nigiri, 2 Salmon Oishi. 4 appies: ebi fritter, squash salad, ahi tuna and braised beef. And I ordered a 1/2 order of the salmon oishi sushi, because obvs. The 5 pieces of rolls were definitely a great way to sample their signature stuff. The salmon oishi was my absolute favourite thing on their menu. The jalapeno provides a kick and crunch, and I truly believe the salmon is laced with buttery magic, because it just melts in your mouth! But OMG the appies is definitely what stuck out. The salad was fresh and had a few pieces of squash which was delicious. The ahi tuna was seared perfectly on the side, accompanied by fresh greens. The ebi fritter was HUGE, and was basically a deep fried prawn with sweet tempura batter. But my favourite was the braised beef - buttery, smooth and on a bed of mash. #LunchDoneRightWe also ended with the Green Tea Opera. I didn't have much, as 6 of us shared the dessert. Presentation was beautiful. The actual dessert was GOOD, but I don't know if I could eat the full thing on my own. Very rich!Dinner: 2 orders of the Salmon Oishi, 1/2 order of the Ebi Oishi and the Coal Harbour Platter. The platter had an array of mussels, clams, raw oysters (my favourite, kushi!), as well as 2 jumbo prawns, scallop ceviche (with a hint of strawberry/citrus flavour) and kale gommae. We ordered the Coal Harbour platter big enough for 1 person, which was a great way to start our dinner for 2. If this was just for myself, it would be a little be overwhelming with all the raw seafood - but hey, if it's your prerogative, go for it! The sushi - great as usual. The salmon oishi (see above) did not disappoint. We tried the Ebi Oishi to change it up. Made with tiger prawn and a hint of lime, it was a refreshing flavor to follow up after the buttery/spicy sushi from the salmon.Although the price of the food is expensive, well worth it.",3/23/2016,5 star rating

I must admit I crave the food so much that I even order it to-go to avoid the long wait times It's worth dining in the restaurant though, the service is always great and the ambiance is lively. Some of my personal favorites: Ebi Fritter, Tofu Salad, Kaisen Soba Pepperoncino (actually obsessed with this), Salmon and Saba oshi sushi, Miku Roll, Shiso Mojito (yum!)They have a great selection of cocktails and sake too, it's a perfect place to sit out on the patio and enjoy the view during the summer time while eating delicious food and amazing drinks!

949,Rala M.,"Burnaby, BC","Very nice view and decent service. I ordered prawn fritter, oyster shooter, and beef carpaccio for appetizer.Prawn fritter: it is like ebi mayo western style with okonomi sauce. Very tasty.                       Side Caesar salad was nice. Oyster Shooter: too much dashi and soy taste. I wish I could taste and enjoy                           more oyster itself... Beef carpaccio: served with Onsen Tamago (hot spring egg: cooked with         water that is approximately 70°C (158ºF) for 30 to 40 minutes.) They use great   quality of beef. Marriage of half cooked egg and aburi thin sliced beef was amazing!Sushi was very westernized. Good quality of Shari (sushi rice), but for me sushi was very greasy. If you are expecting traditional sushi, here is not the place to go. Beautiful place, so good for date or special occasion.",7/29/2015,4 star rating
950,Ben T.,"Chapel Hill, United States",The service was amazing and the sushi was the best that I've ever had. The attention to detail shows though. The oshi sushi is a must!

The salad was gigantic and had a variety of veggies! Not only was I impressed with the portion and variety of the veggies, I was quite mesmerized by how well the dressing worked with the salad!  I believe it was a soy based vinaigrette.  We also ordered a roll (I forgot what it was called) and, I have to say, hands down, the best roll I've had in my entire life! And living in Vancouver my whole life, I've had the luxury of tasting some of the best sushi but this roll just knocked all the rolls I've ever had out of the park! It was just so fresh and well balanced that I just can't imagine any other roll that can top it!If my company paid me more I'd absolutely love to go back, but for now I'll just reminisce lol.",6/21/2014,5 star rating

957,Jenny C.,"San Francisco, United States","We started the night off with a delicious ginger sake cocktail, which even came with a ginger candy in it.  For appetizers, we ordered the oysters (which were great), and a beef carpaccio with a poached egg on top.  Runny egg on top of carpaccio? I'm a fan.The Miku Signature Selection is well worth the $35, providing a strong variety of sushi, ranging from scallop to salmon to aburi nigiri.  As customary with nice sushi restaurants, no soy sauce necessary.  The delicate flavors complemented the sushi nicely and the fish basically melted in your mouth.The dessert was pretty, but nothing outstanding and a little too citrus-y for my taste.",8/26/2014,4 star rating

960,Linda R.,"Plano, United States","Business dinner at Miku in Vancouver did not disappoint.  The Aburi Sushi came highly recommended.  The flame seared aburi added an additional smokey flavor without cooking the nigiri.  As good as the Aburi Nigiri was, the King Roll was excellent with a wonderful sweet chili aioli.  Also enjoyed the sweet chili aioli on the Ebi Fritters.  Strawberry Rhubarb Stilton Cheesecake dessert was a beautiful work of art.  The dessert flavors of the cheesecake and lychee rose sorbet surprising worked together.  The waterfront view from Miku is simply beautiful.  Although we could not get a reservation, we walked in on a very early (5:30p) dinner and was able to get a seat in the lounge.  Win win for us.",8/20/2016,4 star rating

967,Tatiana K.,"Vancouver, BC","I personally think Miku is the best sushi place in Vancouver. It's pricey but I've never had a bad meal there and I've been there over a dozen of times. It's not a place for a quick sushi get together, this is a special occasion place. Good for business lunches too. The quality and freshness is consistent at Miku.  Service has been consistent during my visits - the staff provides enough attention to enjoy the place. They also ask you if you are new to their place or not and provide menu description depending on your experience. My all time favorite is Chirashi tart and Salmon Oshi. Red Wave Roll is pretty good too. Desert options vary depending on the season. Green Tea Opera seems to be a permanent feature - it's delish and incredibly beautiful in appearance! The place gets crazy busy at lunch - reservations are necessary for sure.",11/19/2016,5 star rating

974,Tigran B.,"Vancouver, BC","Pinnacle of Japanese style cooking. I went for a birthday party of 5 people. We were seated no issues. The server came over and explained everything professionally. It was some speech seeing as their was so many things to go over. Kudos to him. The food was delicious. Everything tasted so fresh and it just looked amazing. The service was excellent. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I can never understand the pricing of some of the dishes. Given its is a fine dining restaurant I just don't see myself going there regularly because of some of the prices. And you can say that this is expected when you walked in okay but hear me out. If you are a business and you want to have regulars, you should have a menu that caters to everyone. If you have some cheaper food, then you can bring in a wide range of people with different price points. Sushi in Vancouver is so competitive. Although I doubt having enough covers a night is an issue for Miku and everything flows so well. Kinda funny how many men staff there are though :P",4/4/2016,4 star rating

977,Elaine X.,"Vancouver, BC","I wanted to love Miku, I really did, I hyped myself up so much and was so looking forward to it. Unfortunately, the meal just tasted meh, hence the 3 star rating.Came here with my boyfriend to celebrate. I had read reviews and looked at photos prior so I went directly for the main events and ordered the Salmon Oshi Sushi, Aburi Sushi Sampler, and a piece of the Unagi Nigiri. My boyfriend, who isn't a big fish eater, ordered the Lobster Kaisen Bisque, AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib, and two pieces of Botan Ebi Nigiri.I admit, I made fun of him for coming to a Japanese restaurant and ordering bisque and prime rib - but joke's on me because his meal tasted better than mine!The oshi and aburi sushi in general lacked flavor, I was expecting a nice smoky flavor, or even some fresh fish flavor, but there was just... nothing. The highlight of my night was the single piece of feature roll that came with the sampler and my unagi nigiri - those gave me the much needed flavor that I was looking for the whole night.On the other hand, my boyfriend enjoyed his meal, though not in the portion that he would've liked, but it tasted great. I was going to order the Green Tea Opera dessert that everyone's been raving about here. But after my disappointment with the sushi, we decided to get dessert elsewhere.Overall, the hassle of driving and parking in downtown, the prices, the portions, I've had better - go to Manzo instead.",11/9/2016,3 star rating
978,Irena L.,"Redmond, United States","Every once in awhile you eat a meal that blows you away in every imaginable capacity. For me, it was Miku. Situated by the water in Gastown, Miku is a great date spot, birthday celebration spot, or weekend treat to yoself (because you deserve it!)The difference between 4 stars and 5 stars for is about consistency. A 4 star restaurant means some things are amazing and some of meh/bad. A 5 star is consistent, delicious, amazeball-ness. Sadly, I'm not local so I can't comment on the consistency here across multiple dishes but here's my review on what I ordered. I ordered the Miku Zen: a selection of four seasonal items chosen by the chefs and five pieces of sushi served with signature Aburi sushi and miso soup. The miso soup was delicious. Most places are far too salty because the same soup gets boiled and reduced over and over again. Not here. It was so smooth and delicius and a great way to kick off the meal. I can't say I remember every single item we ate but every single piece was delicious. The salmon Aburi sushi was mindblowing (as expected). I love the kick that the thin slice of jalapeno gave to the overall flavor. The MVP had to be the mackerel aburi sushi though. My friend wasn't a big mackerel fan b/c it's often too fishy and salty. This though...it was insane. I would drive the 2.5hrs to Vancouver JUST for those two aburi sushis. The rest of the pieces were fantastic. I included pics so hopefully that'll suffice. If there was one item that I felt meh about...it was the alaskan salmon nigiri. But that's mostly my own personal taste because I don't like alaskan salmon.",2/17/2016,5 star rating

Came here a few times for many special occasions, such as a birthday, Valentine's day, and a going away dinner, and we were never failed by this restaurant. The interior is beautiful and always clean and pristine, and the view is to die for - we got a window seat on Valentine's day looking over the water and I couldn't have been more in awe!Food is always delicious. I've ordered the sand item every time because of how delicious it is, the lightly seared salmon with jalapenos on top. I don't know why but I can't help but gravitate toward that item, but when I dabble in my friends plates I'm still blown away by their own food choices. It's a little pricey for 6 pieces of sushi but it definitely hits the spot and leaves you satisfied. Staff have been great every time I've been here.

987,Giao T.,"Los Angeles, United States","Miku was highly recommended by my bf's friend so I made reservations as soon as I got the restaurant's name. We were in Vancouver for a long weekend and luckily got reservations for our last night (Tuesday).This place must be the hip place in Vancouver as half the crowd was quite young (early 20's). Nonetheless, restaurant and ambiance were nice. The service and food were also pretty good.We were told Miku is known for aburi style sushi so we ordered the salmon oshi sushi, half miku/half red wave roll, seaweed salad, soba peperoncino, and salmon sushis. I like the innovative aburi style but it didn't wow me. The rolls had small chunks of fish and lots of rice - they're okay... My bf thought the salmon sushi was so fresh though I felt like it was kind of bland and dry, I guess I'm used to the sweet flavors of (probably farm raised) salmon I get in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles... The seaweed salad and soba were delicious. My bf absolutely loved the soba flavors.For dessert, we had the green tea opera. It was okay though it was presented very nicely. I think there may have been too much going on and it wasn't necessarily cohesive in flavors...I'm glad we checked it out.",9/10/2016,4 star rating
988,John C.,"Honolulu, United States","Been to this place a few times now and I am not sure if it's really worth the hype. I love sushi and was really hoping to get some good Pacific Northwest fish when I came home to visit friends and family. However, after a few visits, this place consistently was subpar. It seems to capitalize on its prime location and ambiance. Don't get me wrong, the view of the North Shore mountains is stunning! As for the sushi, this place seems to really underperform. The ratio of fish to rice is really stingy. Their Signature Aburi prime nigiri are also essentially a lot of rice with a very thin layer of seared minced fish on top. Their other nigiri is average as well and nothing about the food at this place was super memorable. They have less than half a page of nigiri/sashimi selection and at minimum $4 per piece you would really expect more fish in these pieces. I really was hoping to love Miku, As it seems like it's kind of the ""go to"" spot for taking clients or visitors for sushi in Vancouver. I even went back two more times as I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt of having an ""off day"". However, I think there are lots of good, albeit smaller sushi places in Vancouver with much better quality and value.",9/30/2018,3 star rating
989,Ann M.,"Richmond, BC","I've been to Miku a couple years back when we celebrated our 10th anniversary and splurged on their Aburi Kaiseki. Won't lie, it was definitely up there in price, but you do get what you paid for and it was an incredible experience. Fast forward to 2017 -  we wanted to try the place again to see if it's just as good compared to back then. It still was. Highlight would be their signature salmon oshi sushi. We ordered their coal harbour platter which was fresh and nicely presented. Another item we decided to try was their Miku roll and that was also delicious. For any matcha lover - do yourself a favour and order their green tea opera cake. It's such a tiny portion, pricey but boy was it GOOD! I'm taking one star off, because upon entering the restaurant, we had told front desk that the women's washroom was out of soap. I thought that was dealt with, but after I had my meal, I went back to the washroom and still out of soap! That was about an hour and a half after. Funny enough, the girl beside me in the washroom mentioned the same thing that she has told them that the soap was out and needs replenishing. I can understand it's busy, but when you have 3-4 girls up in the front, you would think one of them would've gone to the back and refilled the soap dispenser right away. Aside from that mishap, I'd definitely go back in a heartbeat. Pricey? yes. Worth the price? yes.",7/19/2017,4 star rating

I typically go for one of Miku's aburi sushi platters (and order as many orders as there are people in my dining party, for simplicity). I must say however, I wished Miku had more sushi variety. Miku's oshi sushi (pressed sushi) is basically a close permutation of their aburi sushi, and the rolls are nothing special.

Our waiter Tony was excellent - very attentive, walked us through the regular menu, client and personal favourites and explained in detail the Dine Out menu as well.Appetizer was a selection of the following items:MIKU ZEN - a selection of four seasonal items served in a Japanese hinoki boxAburi Salmon Sashimi Salad - johnstone strait sockeye salmon, nutrigreens farm organic greens, citrus ponzu jellyCrab Claw Fritter - herb-beer battered snow crab, sweet chili aioli, soy-balsamic reduction (we got more of these!)Sake Steamed Chicken Breast - fraser valley chicken, pickled cucumber, herb sesame ponzuAburi NY Strip - AAA sterling silver, yukon potato purée, veal jus, wasabi picklesEntree was a selection of the following items:MIKU SIGNATURE SUSHI - selection of Aburi oshi and rollsAburi Salmon Oshi Sushi  - pressed BC wild sockeye salmon, jalapeño, Miku sauce (You NEED to get this!)Sunrise Roll - wasabi marinated albacore tuna, cucumber, wrapped with big-eye tuna, pickled wasabi, flying fish roe, wasabi aioliDine Out Feature Roll - Hokkaido scallop, wrapped with yellowtail, garlic soy, baby carrot leafDessert was a Kahlua Tiramisu Verrine - a walnut cinnamon nougatine cookie but since I have a problem with nuts, Tony thoughtfully brought me out a home made ice cream and sorbet combo which was very refreshing after this meal.The Dine Out menu was a wonderful selection of a mix of items from the current menu and some items just for Dine Out. I can see where is could become a bit expensive during the rest of the year but I think you get good value for your money. Fun atmosphere with a great view of the water (totally romantic)  and the noise level was good until later in the evening - the sound system did get turned up. Was fun to be able to walk over and watch the chefs do their magic. Now, what's my deciding factor between Miku and Minami? I would probably go with Miku - just off of skytrain / seabus and the view really adds to the experience.",2/21/2016,5 star rating
997,MaryJane O.,"Vancouver, BC","Very honestly, I don't think I can add much more to your knowledge of Miku. To reiterate... The food always tastes fresh and delicious, they have the best sparkling sake ever (Indigo Blue), a nice convenient location with a social, trendy ambiance, but most importantly they have outstanding staff! Every time I've been to Miku, they have always been so great at accommodating our needs. Tired babies, (extremely) late girl friends, nit picky parents and grandparents and drunk clients are just some of the small obstacles I've brought with me to Miku. Each and every time, they've handled it with grace. For that, I am so very appreciative of their staff. If they were ever annoyed or upset with the table, I would never have known. I really feel like that level of service is something to be commended for. Especially in Vancouver, where many members of the service industry seems to feel entitled and lack training in the area.",2/11/2016,5 star rating
998,Michelle L.,"Claremont, United States","Good sushi, fresh and delicious. The view from the windows of this place are nice.  Looks like you can see cruise ships coming in and out.  Almost get a view from every seat in this place. Slow service though.",9/30/2017,4 star rating
999,Raffy L.,"Seattle, United States","I found about Miku on here. I knew my girlfriend would be into it because she loves sushi, and we had to try the aburi style. We went there on the Saturday of Valentine's Day weekend. I loved how my request for a window seat for my reservation was satisfied. The service was top notch and our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and even the food prep process to each entrée, dessert, and drink!I highly recommend coming here. The flavors were out of this world, the service was the best, and the ambience was magnificent. Anybody that complains about the sushi is a Japanese ""authentic"" snob because the food isn't drenched in sauces or layered with excess ingredients. 5 star experience!",2/16/2016,5 star rating
1000,Mimi H.,"Seattle, United States","Known for their aburi style sushi (sear-flaming), we came here for lunch and ordered the Miku Zen and Premium sushi lunch. These are great for sharing and let's you try out different items you don't typically find in an ordinary sushi bar.Miku Zen -- It's their take on a bento box that comes with miso soup, four seasonal items, and five pieces of their aburi sushi. Our four items included a salad with crispy bacon, albacore in a light yuzu sauce, battered prawn drizzled with sweet chili aioli, and braised beef shank over a potato puree in wasabi infused au jus. All interesting and good but the aburi selection was  delicious. There's just something about fatty fish being lightly seared. Flavors were there and the fish almost melts in your mouth.Premium Sushi Lunch -- YUMMY! Comes with twelve pieces total: three traditional nigiri, three aburi nigiri, four aburi oshi, and two aburi sushi rolls. Perfect balance of everything for the fish lovers. While most people love the salmon aburi, I thought the eel and albacore were amazing! I would also recommend ordering aburi style for any other nigiri or sashimi for $.25 more.Huge dining area compared to normal Japanese/sushi restaurants with select seats outdoor as well. Overall great service and their restrooms are above average and clean! Reservations also available through OpenTable, not sure if this is great for parties over 6.",12/4/2015,4 star rating
1001,Asha S.,"Newport Beach, United States","Not a fan. I don't get what all the hype is about. I didn't think the sushi or sashimi was anything special. I've actually had much better sushi in LA. I also didn't think the ambiance was very nice. Service was very slow. The views were great though, I'll give them that. And I also liked how you could do half orders of most items so you could try more dishes.",6/2/2016,3 star rating

The best best best thing I had was the Ebi Fritter aka fried shrimp. It was ridiculously amazing. I should have ordered 2 and made it into an entree.

1004,Danielle L.,"Vancouver, BC","I like Miku, and have been here a number of times, both with small groups of friends and large groups, and I am just not sure what all the fuss is about.  It's good, but it's not THE BEST RESTAURANT EVER, which seems to be the prevailing opinion among my friends.  If you like Japanese food, you'll like Miku.  If you LOOOOOOOOOVE Japanese food, you'll probably love it.My latest experience there was in the private room.  They can accommodate three tables of 8 - no long table and for our group of 16 it meant we were seated separately, which we were apprehensive about but worked out OK.  For groups, the menu is set, and we were allowed no substitutions, even when we offered to pay for them. We were allowed to specify ""no raw"" for those of us who are not sashimi-fans, and that worked out OK.  There was a little ""trading"" that went on amongst us when we were served something we didn't care for, but in the end everyone enjoyed their meal.The $38 lunch group menu is really good value.  The Miku Zen appetizer is a selection of a number of seasonal items: we have a little bit of the Jidori Chicken Nanban - which is TO DIE FOR - the TARTAR SAUCE OMG, aburi tuna, a delightful baked sable fish served with a really yummy kale, and an OK shrimp cocktail.  The second course was a selection of 5 pieces of sushi, which were excellent but darned if I knew what any of them were - best advice is not to ask, just eat!    And dessert was the Green Tea opera cake which was rich but not too rich, decadent and refreshing.The service was very attentive, with the exception of the reception (hostesses) - it took them about 10 minutes to take our coats and show us where the room was, and one of them gave away my umbrella on a very rainy day because someone had told her ""they would give it to me"" (you can guess what happened to it - Dani needs an umbrella!). We had a nice get-together, although lunch took almost two and a half hours.  If you're planning on coming with a group, plan to be there awhile.",12/9/2015,3 star rating
1005,Kate R.,"Rochester, United States",Our meals at Miku were unbelievable. Everything was incredibly fresh and flavorful. The red wave roll is the best sushi roll I've ever had.

1009,Beffrey W.,"Baltimore, United States","Food: 5Ambiance: 4Service: 3We decided spur of the moment to get a light dinner here on a Friday around 7pm. Place was in full swing but thankfully there were a few seats left at the bar.  Grabbed seats that directly faced the TV -- good so we could watch the football game, but odd because a TV really doesn't fit in with the otherwise demure feel.The king roll was pretty tasty, could tell they used quality ingredients, but otherwise didn't have anything that really set it apart from rolls we've had elsewhere.  The salmon oishi sushi though - SO GOOD.  Definitely get it.  The salmon is sliced super thin and is tender, the flame sear on top is perfect, and the condensed soy is the right amount of extra salt.  Even the tiny slivers of jalapeño lend a small hint of spiciness.  The rolls aren't served with extra soy sauce, and you shouldn't waste the rolls by asking for it since they're delicious on their own.Unfortunately the service was not great (even though we don't expect too much when we sit at the bar). Took a while to get drink menus, to order, and to have anyone come back around to ask for refills or for new drink orders.  The restaurant was pretty busy and we could see the the bartenders were going nonstop, but still.  One of the bartenders was helpful with menu and drink recommendations, the other one we had to ask twice for waters.Overall, would come back to try more things on the menu.",12/4/2015,4 star rating

We didn't know what to expect but the place was 4 and a half stars so we thought why not. I got there around dinner time and waited about 45 minutes. We sat at the bar and the bartender/waitor was very friendly. We ordered two drinks which were both delicious. I forgot what my gf ordered but I ordered the Little Emporer which was very good. We then ordered the calamari, shrimp, and a variety of sushi including their seared salmon. The calamari and shrimp were so soft and delicious. The sushi was the same as well. The seared salmon however... was... Im sorry I was about to cry. It was so amazing. The experience that it gave me was one I could never imagine from food. I love that seared salmon.

Upon recommendation, we ordered the Ebi fritters which are like very thinly breaded tempura and very delicious. You also get a small salad with it as appetizer. Ordered 3 orders of the oshi (prawn and salmon), it actually melts right into your mouth and is wonderfully flavoured. The rolls were not particularly special but they were definitely above average and blended well together. Also got the sashimi platter, it was incredibly plated and very fresh as well. Finally, dessert was ended off with the green tea opera. I love green tea anything so it was definitely great, although the most special part was the presentation.

It was rather spacious that day, although it was dinner time. -We had just hiked and was dressed very casually - Upon entering, we were questioned as to whether we made a reservation (which we didn't)- The lady then looked at us from head to toe, discussed with some of her fellow workers, then decided ""Well okay...

1044,Kunal T.,"San Francisco, United States","BOOM! Honestly one of the best fresh seafood places I have been to. We went with a pretty big group around 16-17 people and rented the private room in the back (called Blue Sky...WHATT this room had its own Wifi). Started off with 2-3 appetizers must get the seaweed salad (it is honestly one of the best salads I have ever had....and I'm the king of organic). Sashimi followed after the fish was so fresh and well decorated. For the 2nd course it is to die for the scallops, tuna (which was alright), and calamari (this was amazing). The calamari is dipped in a great sweet sauce that hits the spot. For the main entrees, I would highly recommend getting their famous double sushi salmon roll, the sablefish was amazing it was perfectly cooked, very tender, and literally the freshest fish in the sea. Lastly top it off with the Green tea opera cake - great combination of crunch, sweet, caffeine, and different blends in your mouth.The service overall was amazing - very prompt, great managers, very friendly, and overall a great vibe to add to their amazing food!I would highly recommend this place when visiting Vancouver and seeing this amazing city!",11/4/2015,5 star rating
1045,Ann T.,"Montreal, QC","Miku is owned by the same guys that own Minami so I already knew the food wouldn't disappoint me. Location: I'm on the fence; they're located on the waterfront (on Granville) but the building itself looks more like an office building than a restaurant, and if I didn't know they were in there, I would never even think to look. You also don't actually have a view of the water (at least not from where I was sitting). That being said, it's about 10 minutes from downtown on foot, making this place easily accessible (especially if you work nearby). Service: Excellent. The wait staff was very attentive and happy to make recommendations. My water glass was always full which makes me a happy camper.Food: Delicious! We had:Spicy Shrimp and Pork Gyoza, served with sweet miso pork belly and chilli pepper coulis. These were amazing and came piping hot. The dough was just a touch crispy and the stuffing was juicy. Yum!Hamachi Carpaccio (flame seared, thin slices of Yellow-tail with an citrus avocado  sauce. The Yellow-tail was perfectly seared and blended perfectly with the sauce. I wasn't sure how I would feel about carpaccio, and was pleasantly surprised. Snow Crab & Heirloom Tomato Match Soba: Freaking phenomenal - garlic dashi, shrimp, shaved fennel, shiso, wild arugula, green tea Soba noodles served chilled. It was a refreshing dish that oozed with flavor. Aburi Salmon: Pressed BC Sockeye salmon, Jalapeno and Miku sauce. Since Aburi is their specialty, I had to see what all the fuss was about. Both the salmon and Ebi were delicious. My favorite was the prawn - the combination of flavors stood out a little more for me. Aburi Ebi: Pressed prawn, lime zest, Ume sauce.Price: It's a little steep but worth it. I suggest going with a few people so that you can try out a variety of their dishes.",8/14/2013,4 star rating

1049,0 L.,"Emeryville, United States","I saw on the menu that the chef had a Japanese name. So... I was extremely disappointed at the rolls I got. First of all, the rice is all wrong! It's mushy just like the pre prepped stuff and I can tell it's not hand prepped but device pressed... The vegi roll was the worst I've had to date. It had sweet ginger wrapped with a skinny asparagus and avocado inside the rice, wrapped in pickled radish and red pepper. So... It tastes only of the radish and ginger, extremely dissatisfied.The red wave was another disappointment. The crab was mixed in meyo... I completely didn't expect meyo in a roll that costs $16 with real crab... What a waste imo.The salmon oshi sushi had meyo glazed on... I read later their ""specialty"" is Aburi which means to lightly sear.I can only imagine they do this to hide the fishiness of old or not so tasty fish. Needless to say, I could taste the meyo, if the salmon were top notch fresh stuff, it was wasted.This place is very busy, people love the ambiance, the presentation, the service are all so great. But people, this isn't japanese sushi... Real sashimi/sushi is the art of cutting fish so it melts in your mouth. Well, the chef isn't really Japanese trained... Not at all in Japanese food actually :) my mistake completely for expecting Japanese sensibilities.",7/21/2015,1 star rating

We politely asked them to give one of those tables since we need a little extra space for a baby and don't want to sit on that ultra small table.

He brought us our tea... and I don't know if I was more thirsty than usual, but I'm not kidding, the flavour in their tea hit me like a ton of bricks. I felt alive, and it got my apetite going.First up, sashimi assortment: Absolutely delicious. Next, Salmon Oshi Sushi: I can't even remotely describe how amazing this tray was. It was an entire experience in itself. The flavours were harmonious and it melted in your mouth. By far the best sushi I've ever had (within Canada)!I highly recommend this place. It's definitely one I'd dine in again, and this time, dressed nicely. Check it out and make sure to get the Oshi Sushi. Trust me, you'll brag about this gem to everyone you know.",4/15/2016,5 star rating
1052,Robyn H.,"San Francisco, United States","This was my first experience with aburi style suhi, and I have to say I was impressed with the quality here.  The BF and ventured here while we were in Vancouver for a weekend getaway, and this was our first food experience of the trip.When we first sat down, we noticed a fantastic sake selection and ordered a bottle.  I know zero about sake, and I typically don't even like sake, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I must have been drinking garbage before testing out a truly well selected sake menu.  I wish I remembered which bottle we got, but alas, I don't.The server informed us they do not serve soy sauce with their sushi and that we would not need it.  This indicates quality of ingredients and careful preparation.  The highlight of our meal was the premium aburi nigiri platter.  The flame searing process added a light, smoky flavor without fully cooking the fish.  Each selection of fish was thoughtfully paired with sauces and garnishes that amplified the flavor profile and highlighted the beauty of the ingredients.  We both agreed that our favorite bite of the evening was a shrimp nigiri with a beautiful pesto sauce.  I've had shrimp and pesto many a time, but this stood out as a bite of heaven.Apart from the fantastic food and drinks, we had such kind, attentive service and enjoyed the view so much that we had to come back a second time before leaving Vancouver.  Thank you Miku for starting our trip right!",11/10/2015,5 star rating

1056,Yvonne L.,"Vancouver, BC","We arrived at 8:15pm on a Saturday night and waited about 1.5 hours for the patio. I must say the wait was worth it as the view was gorgeous! Our party of four ordered 4 oyster shooters, the Miku Waterfront Platter, Miku Signature Selection, Salmon Oshi Sushi, two bottles of Pinot Grigio, and the Green Tea Opera. The oyster shooters were delicious- though a little pricey at $4 a shot. The Miku Waterfront Platter, while visually stunning, was mediocre. The sashimi was fresh, but the shellfish (clams, mussels, and oysters) were underwhelming. Because of the recent ban of West Coast raw oysters, we were given East Coast oysters instead. The oysters were so tiny and not worth the premium price we paid. Miku Signature Selection was good, but a smaller portion than we expected. Salmon Oshi Sushi was tasty (loved the black pepper), but I honestly prefer Kishimoto's version, which is way more generous with the fish. The Green Tea Opera was the highlight of the night. I am not usually a fan of desserts, but this had a wonderful creamy/crunchy texture and was not overly sweet!Overall, I think Miku is a good restaurant. I love the ambience, as well as how knowledgeable the servers are. However, for the premium pricing, I really expected more flavour-wise.",9/13/2015,4 star rating
1057,Philip M.,"Pomona, United States","All I can say is WOW!  Miku is a high end restaurant that sets the bar in terms of ambiance, presentation and service.  While on the high end of the spectrum in terms of price, Miku delivered in all aspects.  Our waiter Andy was very attentive and knowledgeable on the food he was serving as well as the different sakes he recommended us to try.  Aside from the perfect service, let me tell you about the food!  We started our meal with the wagyu carpaccio and it literally melted in our mouths.  While carpaccio is raw beef, there was a hint of ponzu on the plate that cured the meat similar to how lemon cures ceviche.  This plate is definitely something to order to get the night started.  Our group decided to all order the aburi prime which was 9 piece omakase selected by the chefs.  If you've ever been to heaven, this is exactly that! Each piece of fish is specifically picked by the chef including sauces that are paired perfectly.  Our selection are as follows - Snapper with Monkfish liver, Red Tuna with Foie gras, Mackerel with dashi jelly, Salmon with Jalapeño miso reduction, Flounder with caviar, Blue Fin Tuna Belly with daikon, Scallops with yuzu, Lobster with Wasabi, and Wagyu with Uni.  I highly recommend Miku if you are a big sushi eater.  The selection is remarkable and the food literally melts in your mouth.  It will remain a go to whenever I am in the city.",1/17/2018,5 star rating
1058,Tiff P.,"Los Angeles, United States","I made a reservation for 2 for lunch. When I got there (less than 15 mins late), I was told they gave my table away. I was super upset about that because they didn't try calling me to ask where I was. After some wait, I ended up being placed at a booth with a time limit of 1 hour...Our server was really kind, made some recommendations, and hurriedly placed our order. I personally enjoyed the prawn aburi and would highly recommend trying it. It had so many different flavors going on made the best impression. I would say the salmon aburi ranked second.

1059,Mavis C.,"Walnut, United States","I used to dine at Miku often for both personal and business.  I liked the restaurant so much that I celebrated my birthday there two years in a row; however, the second time turned out to be a horrible experience (my worst birthday dinner ever!) and I had not been back to Miku since.  As the food is always good at Miku, what made the second experience so bad was the service.  To start off, our waiter had some funny attitude and poor service.  We didn't really mind because my birthday happened to be on DineOut week, so it's understandable that the staff may be a bit overwhelmed.  However, the worst part came when we told our waiter that it's my birthday and he did not believe us.  He gave us a ""yea-right"" look and walked away (what!).  Of course, he did not bring me any dessert for celebration after meal, as the waiter from my previous year birthday dinner kindly did, so we ordered a dessert ourselves and asked for a candle on top.  And of course, the dessert came with no candle.  At that point we had enough and just wanted to leave the unhappy place and asked for our bill.  Everything came slow that day - the only thing that came fast was the bill.  We walked into Miku with happiness that day, but got served with attitude / distrust and walked out with unpleasant memories.  I know it may just be one bad waiter out of the entire team, but why should I take my chances?  Goodbye, Miku.",4/19/2019,2 star rating
1060,Mendy H.,"San Jose, United States","Food was great - I wouldn't say spectacular, but definitely way above average and there were a few amazing dishes including their signature salmon oshi sushi which is a MUST. Ambiance is really nice; the restaurant is right by the water and has a great view through the windows. We were a group of four, walked in a little past 5 pm on a Saturday with no reservation and sat at the bar without any wait.

1061,Anthony S.,"Seattle, United States","Oh, how I wanted to really like Miku Restaurant.Over the summer, I spent my first 'food-cation' to Vancouver.  Of course prior to going, I Yelp'd all the top spots and check Eater as needed to get my itinerary of places to go.  Miku was amongst the top of the list.  From what fans raved about the Salmon oshi sushi to the magnificent views - my heart was racing before I even entered Canada borders.My girlfriend and I had our hearts set on the omakase meal.  Sadly, omakase was limited to dinner only.  Other notes:Parking was easy.  I chanced upon a $5 lot on a weekend off of Pender / Granville.  Way cheaper than the $19 parking lot, located directly adjacent to the restaurant and the convention center.Crowd: Opentable reservations made it really easy to avoid waiting for a table.  We got there right when it opened at 11:30, and got the perfect table with the magnificent view of the water and mountains.  By about 11:45, the place was packed.  So glad we booked ahead.Service was spot on.  Checking in consistently without overbearing or being too pushy.The food on the other hand sadly, was nothing to write home about.  The sushi rice was mushy and lacked flavor. Rice makes up more than 70% of the meal when you think about it.  Rice typically requires the right handling for cooking, fanning it to cool it and to not overcook it.  The rice morsels mushed together before even biting.  While this helped keep the sushi held tightly together in its hand shaped figure, the texture was off-putting.The fish pieces were cut meagerly and laid atop the rice.  While all ingredients appeared fresh and did not disappoint in respect to quality and freshness, the assembly and execution of the meal failed to meet the expectations put forth by an impressive establishment you experience as you enter the vicinity. For a higher priced meal, yes the price point lived up to this venue's expectations, the meal itself lacked luster and sparkle you'd envision to accompany such an amazing dining experience. Overall, I rate this spot 3 stars.  While all other aspects of the restaurant exceeded expectations - the main event, the food - was just adequate.",10/13/2015,3 star rating
1062,Diana S.,"Chicago, United States","Food: we went there for lunch. I had the chirashi tart which is their version of a chirashi bowl. It was tasty but there was too much sauce. I like my sushi to be very simple: piece of fish, rice and wasabi. Miku's specialty is different types of sauces and flame seared- the Aburi Oshi sushi. My boyfriend got a few of those rolls and they were delicious. Service: we ordered dessert as they looked incredible but they never came and we had to run to catch a flight. However, our waiter was sincerely apologetic and nice so it really didn't make a difference. He was helpful and answered all our questions throughout the meal.

Reasons given: ""if we don't others will"", we have a sister restaurant that serves purely sustainable seafood (..whaaat?!), our clientele demand it, it's a cut throat marketIn the end it's true, it's driven by the patrons and the economics. Perhaps a sad message of some of the patrons.

I'll try not to get into details, but the fish is so perfectly cooked that it almost melts in your mouth.

1068,Leon A.,"Culver City, United States","I went to Vancouver for vacation with a friend, and all of my friends who lived there recommended this restaurant to me as one of the best places here to get sushi. Atmosphere: The restaurant has a fantastic location. I wasn't fortunate enough to receive a patio table, but the inside of the restaurant was nice due to the open kitchen. Interior design-wise, this restaurant is pretty lacking. The big painted fish on the ceiling look quite cheesy to me. Everyone around me seemed dressed a bit higher than casual. Maybe somewhere along the lines of business casual. Service: My waitress was very professional and made great conversation. Sometimes when I needed her, though, she disappeared for at least 15 minutes before I can get a hold of her. All of the servers were extremely knowledgable of the menu. Food: I ordered oyster shots, the salmon aburi, premium aburi nigiri, wagyu nigiri, the red wave roll, and the green tea opera cake. Every dish was extremely refined. The only problem I had was that most of them didn't really stand out to me as anything amazing. Great tasting - yes - but nothing extraordinary. Given the amazing reviews from this restaurant, I came in expecting a better-than-great experience. I do, however, enjoy the subtle dimensions in flavors in each dish. The smoky taste of the aburi is very present and definitely worth experiencing. Surprisingly my favorite dish was the green tea opera cake. This is the must-order dish if you decide to go to this restaurant.",10/7/2015,4 star rating

Two words can describe the food. EXTREMELY SALTY! We had calamari for appetizer, it came with soy sauce at the bottom. Calamari is supposed to be crispy, but the sauce made it very soggy and very salty. If you want to order sushi, you better not dip it into the soy sauce because it comes with a salty dressing on top. The one star is only for the service. Remember to order a big glass on water because you need it to help you swallow the food. That's what I did.",8/6/2017,1 star rating

While it appears they spent a lot in the interior its not quite my style.It is delicious yet pricey so be prepared. It is nice to visit and treat yourself here and there. To remind you what sushi is about. If you haven't tried it before at copycat places, I recommend at least ordering the aburi sushi. Essentially pressed boxed sushi with a little sauce that has been slightly torched on top. My description may be terrible but try the salmon and ebi.PS: They offer some pretty high end sake.

They allow you to order half rolls so it came out as the perfect amount of food. You also must try the salmon Aburi Oshi Sushi. It was amazing and one of the most interesting sushi bites I've ever had. My boyfriend got the prime rib which was also delicious. Finished off the meal with the green tea opera.

1089,Kenneth L.,"Vancouver, BC","Skip the dineout menu, it's basically a sampler tasting menu and itself is barely enough to feed an underweight female child...for breakfast. It consists of 5 pieces of sushi and four small plates of sample bites of their menu. I'd advise staying out of Miku until the end of the month and then coming back afterwards when the crowds die down a bit. Don't misunderstand, this place serves amazing rolls and is one of the few places that I can genuinely say truly reinvents and improves on tried and true sushi. You won't find your typical boring reimagined Tuna roll with mayo here. Every roll done that I've tried has a purpose and an intent to be different from what's served in every run of the mill sushi place. Service is extremely attentive and welcoming even during the dineout frenzy, drink options plentiful and well worth trying (some great Sochu options on the menu), views of Canada Place are great if you can score a window seat.5 Stars for the restaurant's main menu, ambiance, service, location, creativity etc., 1 star docked for being slightly disingenuous with their dineout menu. If you can't participate properly for $40... don't.

1090,Barry R.,"Pittsburgh, United States","I've eaten an ocean of sushi in my life time and Miku is hands down the best fusion sushi I've ever had!  Their specialty is aburi style sushi which is seared to add to the flavor.  We got the seaweed salad, aburi eel, sushi tart, and green tea opera dessert.  Every dish was inventive, well prepared, perfectly balanced, and all get a Triple A+ for presentation.  As appetizing as they all looked, we all hesitated to dig in because we felt so guilty wrecking the artistic masterpieces they brought out to us on every plate. The staff was extremely friendly, fast, and helpful.  The stereo bumped hip acid jazz while we overlooked the ocean and cruise ships from one of the best views in Vancouver.  Your mouth will love you, but your wallet will hate you, so this is definitely a special occasion spot.  You can find better deals on basic traditional sushi (I recommend Kaide Sushi nearby) but I've never had better modern fusion sushi anywhere, including in Tokyo!",5/10/2015,5 star rating

It's approachable sushi made with exceptional skill and some innovative twists (i.e. sauces). The whole experience was supported by an exceptional server; she loved the food and her advice was welcome.It's great and I'd certainly return.

1097,Damian C.,"Hamilton, ON","I recently travelled to Vancouver and my main mission there was to taste some of the best Japanese food on offer. I looked online for advice and Miku was one of the most popular places with mostly positive reviews. Upon walking in I was greeted warmly by the staff in Japanese and seated promptly. The general atmosphere is somewhat upscale and the staff is very friendly and helpful with making your food and drink selection. So far so good.So here I was stuffing my face with the chefs selection of sashimi, as well as uni, hamachi and otoro nigiri. The chefs selection consisted of salmon, red snapper, yellowtail and prawn sashimi. While the yellowtail was deliciously buttery and melt in your mouth, the the rest of the sashimi disappointed. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't hold up to the same level of freshness/quality as the yellowtail. Next was the uni, hamachi and otoro nigiri. I was very impressed with the otoro and highly recommend it. It is pricey, but definitely need to try at least one. The uni and hamachi were also tasty. I tried a lightly seared hamachi nigiri as well, but I didn't like it as much.At the end of the meal and almost $70 later I can't say I can recommend Miku solely on the food I had. However, if atmosphere is a key factor in deciding where you dine, then Miku will not disappoint. 3.5/5 for me.",8/26/2014,3 star rating

We didn't go without a filled water glass the entire evening, and when the food was delivered they took great care in explaining the process and ingredients every time. Our server was super knowledgeable and friendly, and prepared a menu for us when we communicated that we wanted to try as much variety as possible. When we mentioned it was our anniversary, they went to the effort of writing it on our desert plate which was wonderful of them. Now, most importantly, the food. I was speechless after eating it. The fish was so flavorful and was as smooth as butter, the flavors were so masterfully complimentary, the ingredients were of amazing quality, and everything was made to perfection. I finally understand why rice and wasabi is so important to sushi, as well as not needing soy sauce to complete a roll. This place has ruined me for the avocado filled rolls back home. All the fish is fresh and sustainably caught which makes me feel even better about coming here. Also, the shiso mojito I had was as gorgeous as it was delicious.All in all, this place is worth the price for the service alone, but the food and palpable passion put into makes this restaurant a must visit.",5/31/2016,5 star rating
1099,Jackie Y.,"Diamond Bar, United States",I heard about this place from a friend and was happy to see good reviews. Excellent service. Nice modern  decoration and clean.  Music is a bit too noisy  but ok.  I was to able to sit without  reservation.  I had the set menu and everything  was delicious except the yellow tail. Salmon Oishi was excellent.  I also appreciate the  edible flowers and their grated wasabi  they used on my sushi.  Not an authentic Japanese but a nice Japanese  fusion  restaurant. I would come here again.,12/2/2017,5 star rating
1100,Shanti M.,"Toronto, ON",Gorgeous view if you are entertaining and need something more 'impressive' than its sister Minami in Yaletown. The Aburi flamed sushi is AMAZING- all are good but salmon is my favourite. Sablefish is delicious too.,11/26/2016,5 star rating
1101,Timothy L.,"Chicago, United States","My sushi life changed the moment I bit into my first aburi sushi at Miku. How could I have missed this incredible sensation all my life? The light, delicate smokey flavor with a kiss of citrus over high quality fish. I suggest you try all of the aburi, but the salmon stands out as the best. I've come here several times now and try and they consistently well-execute the food and service every time.",3/16/2016,5 star rating

1108,Sheila J.,"Northern Liberties, Philadelphia, United States","I will not be back at this restaurant and I would probably recommend this restaurant to someone I don't like. For me, service is EVERYTHING! This restaurant is modern, has a nice view and is in a good location. We came here on Friday night with a large group of 18. We were told that we would have separate tables but that the tables would be next to each other for our group. Upon arrival, our group was completely separated and in different dining areas. I talked to 2 members of the staff and even asked the manager to move our table so that we can be with the group. Even though there were 2 empty tables next to us the entire time we were there, they wouldn't accommodate us. The manager then promised to move us next to the table in the other dining room when it opened up, but that never happened either. The food here is alright is but the customer service was not good at all in my opinion. I am a believer that customer service is a huge factor in the complete dining experience and this place did not meet my expectations.",5/26/2015,2 star rating
1109,Lisa K.,"Toronto, ON","Lovely location, hip decor, friendly service. I visited twice within a few days, and here is my report.The menu includes some vegan and some gluten-free items, but not a ton of either and not much overlap between the two. What they do have is pretty amazing though. The garden roll has to be the best vegan maki roll I've ever tasted. Seriously: try it. They carry gluten-free soy sauce, and they understand the importance of being careful about gluten for the sake of people like my husband who has celiac disease.The friends we dined with on the first visit warned us that the chef is known for being unwilling to alter the dishes. So if you ask for wasabi to accompany a dish that was already perfectly seasoned with the appropriate amount of wasabi, don't expect to be given any wasabi. But you'll discover the dish really was perfectly seasoned with the appropriate amount of wasabi, so you won't need any extra anyway!On the second visit, we went with someone who insisted on ordering off menu, and this led to confirmation of the reluctance to alter dishes in response to customer requests. Nevertheless, the staff handled themselves with grace and good humor. Overall, I was very impressed. If the menu could be expanded to include more vegan and more gluten-free items (with more overlap between the two), we'll definitely be back (with reservations, which help ensure a good table).",3/22/2015,4 star rating

1122,Julie B.,"Manhattan, United States","It wasn't bad, but not worth the money. While visiting NYC we wanted some sushi so stopped in on a Sunday night. We ordered the Ebi fritters, Aburi prime (9 nigiri pieces), the Miku signature selection (an assortment of rolls, nigiri, and lightly seared rectangular nigiri), and the waterfront platter (a $100 raw seafood platter). Ebi fritters tasted basically like rock shrimp - pretty pleasant and a nice way to start the meal. The waterfront platter was fresh, with an assortment of raw mussels, clams, sashimi, oysters, poke, and octopus ceviche. It was very fresh and the poke and octopus were standouts. The sushi was not bad but nothing special either, which I was disappointed about given all the rave reviews. If you're new to sushi you might be impressed as everything looked pretty and well put together, but the flavors were underwhelming and the fish was nothing to write home about, in fact a bit on the thin side. If you're a sushi aficionado, I'd probably skip this place. Ambiance is trendy, service is fast, and the cocktails are decent if all on the slightly sweet side. Praline and red bean dessert with lychee ice cream was good.",12/23/2018,3 star rating

I see this a lot in European Countries and it really gave me a sense of feel being back home. However, as pretty as it looks, it did not really deliver in terms of flavor. It lacked the wow-factor and I really wanted more of a balance between the green tea and chocolatey layers of the cake. My friend had two scoops of coconut poppyseed lime sorbet. That was fantastic.

They seemed to be known for seared fresh fish. Miku did not disappoint at all. In addition I ordered the housemade match ice cream.

1145,Jenny L.,"San Francisco, United States","I do not understand the high ratings for this place. The food is mediocre. Fresh on some and not so much on most. For the price and the pretentious air they put up like this is a fancy restaurant I expected more. If you are looking for authentic Japanese cuisine this is not the place. If you just want to pay a high price and be seen and doesn't care about the quality of the food you put in your mouth then you have found the place! Or maybe I have been spoiled with the restaurants in San Francisco and only expect great quality. Some of the food here taste no better than at a buffet. We ordered the sashimi plate ($25 - added 2 piece of otoro tuna @ $5 each - total $35), raw oysters ($4 each that day), miso soup, red shrimp and scallop nigiri and the famous aburi oshi salmon...sorry I forgot the other prices. The only good piece on the sashimi plate was the hamachi, it was soooo good but that was the end of it. The otoro tuna was ""stiff"", sockeye salmon was mushy and the scallop has no taste. Miso soup was a little above average but the most disappointing part was their famous aburi oshi salmon. It's like eating a spoonful of oil and rice with some torched taste. I couldn't eat more than a piece and couldn't wait to leave the restaurant to find another place to eat which we did. The 2 stars are for the partial view.

I don't mean to offend anyone but I have to say that the yelling of  "" irasshaimase"" by non Asian staff sounds extremely odd and forced...which made me feel extremely put off right from the start. The location and the aesthetic appeal are the only reason I'm giving this spot any stars at all. The hosts were nice enough but the guys at the bar were extremely rude and acted like people around them were almost like peasants to them, not the type of attitude you'd want when coming to a place like this, or anywhere to be honest. I will say that the Salmon Oshi is very delicious but at $16 for 6 pieces it's pretty steep.

1149,Kky C.,"Vancouver, BC","Walking in to this restaurant and seeing the ambiance and decor, I knew right away that Miku is not attempting to be a 100% authentic Japanese restaurant and therefor shouldn't be compared to the more traditional sushi spots in Vancouver. However there were several things that were very poorly executed, so much so that I'm not sure I'll come back unless someone can convince me otherwise. This review is pretty thorough so I do hope management reads it and takes it into consideration.First Impressions/Environment: Words cannot describe how poorly trained the hostess at the door was. She told us it would be a 40 minute wait for a seat at the bar, and longer for a seat at a proper table. Given the popularity of this restaurant, I'd say that's fair and we happily waited. However when we were brought to our seats, we realized that by ""bar"" she meant drinking bar, not sushi bar. This mildly annoyed my husband but then again we never asked for clarification, so we didn't make a fuss of it until she sat us at the seats directly facing the back of a DISHWASHER, with steam, heat, and a foul smell all wafting in our faces. We then looked to the sushi bar on the other side and saw 5 empty seats. We asked the hostess if we could be seated there instead and she said yes. She asked us to go back and wait at the door, then came back 2 minutes later saying we can proceed to the sushi bar. So why would she put us in front of a dishwasher if there were other seats available in the first place? And why couldn't we move directly from the bar to sushi bar, as opposed to walking back and forth to the entrance for no explicable reason? Dinner Service: Our server was really nice. I didn't catch her name but based on her accent she was Japanese and  her warm hospitality reflected such. She explained some of the popular menu items and checked in on us several times throughout the evening. She was extremely busy but still managed to provide great service. I tipped generously for this reason and this reason alone. The Food: We ordered the Waterfront Platter, Botan Ebi Sashimi,  Salmon Oshi Sushi, and an assortment of aburi and traditional nigiri. The Waterfront Platter was presented beautifully but taste-wise was a mixed bag. Oysters, octopus, and ceviche were very fresh and tasty. (there was a small bone in the ceviche though) Mussels, clams, prawns however were not. The freshly ground and toasted sesame seed dressing for the gomaae was very fragrant but the kale was just chewy and unpleasant. Sticking to spinach would've been a better idea for this item. Botan Ebi Sashimi was very fresh and presented beautifully. Fresh, sweet, and none of the mucous that you find on spot prawns found in cheaper sushi restaurants. Salmon Oshi Sushi was underwhelming. We ordered this because it was recommended by our server, but honestly all I could taste was the sauce/mayonnaise... Since we were sitting at the bar, we could see the sushi chef preparing these by massive metal platters, I think everyone there had one order (or more) of this on their table. But the fish to rice ratio was lacking, and I could barely taste the salmon due to the mayonnaise. I will give props to the chef for pressing the Oshi Sushi to just the right firmness. Firm enough to stay together, but not so much that the rice would be too densely packed. That aspect of it was executed very well. Aburi and Traditional Nigiri: Ootoro was probably the most buttery of the ootoro that I've had in Vancouver. The mackerel was also well marinated and soft unlike the cardboard you get at so many other restaurants. Everything else was underwhelming though, and the biggest problem was that most of the sushi just fell apart as soon as we picked them up. We watched the chef prepare the nigiri, and based on how quickly he was pumping them out  (2 seconds/piece I kid you not) we were not entirely surprised by our sushi falling apart... The seam of the nori on our ikura nigiri was already peeling off by the time our server dropped it off. Our total bill came to $147 after tax, before tip. Our overall impression was that Miku is using the best ingredients available to them (oysters, spot prawns, and ootoro speak to that) but a lot of it is marred by poor design/execution (bone in ceviche, overpowering sauces, sushi falling apart). Watching the way the sushi bar functioned in a factory-like way was somewhat uncomforting and made me want to question the quality even before the food arrived in front of me. And indeed, I was disappointed by the sushi that came from it. Maybe I'll give Miku another try if invited by a friend, but next time I will stay away from their sushi and perhaps try one of their main entrees instead.  2/5 stars: one for our fantastic server, and one for the great spot prawns, but nothing else...",9/4/2017,2 star rating

1151,Ladd V.,"Calabasas, United States","Great dining experience the food was amazing our Server James was a great help and very well versed on the menu.  Great view of the ocean and 5 sails located near the convention center . Great view of my wife also, lol. I highly recommend this restaurant but only if you are not concerned on the price . If you are on a budget this restaurant is not for you, most likely the most expensive restaurant in Vancouver. After eating enough to be satisfied the price including tip was $280 Canadian dollars . If I were not a bit of a price conscious person I would give it 5 stars but I am not a big fan of super over priced restaurants . So if price is no object and you love Sushi and a great dining experience definitely try this restaurant while you are in Vancouver Canada . Bon appetite.",9/2/2017,4 star rating
1152,Steve B.,"San Marcos, United States","Three of us had dinner at Miku on a recent visit to Vancouver. None of us had ever tried Aburi sushi before but we loved it!  Tried the salmon oshi, shrimp oshi, and red wave. Also had some of the nigiri. The aburi was quite different from other sushis and very, very good.  All the fish was extremely fresh and well prepared.  We enjoyed the oshi ""rolls"" so much we ordered another order of each.  Decent beer selection.  Great cocktails.  Amazing view and location.  We got lucky to get a table on a Saturday night at 6.  The restaurant is large but you should definitely make a reservation if you want to avoid a potentially long wait.  The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that the sushi menu is somewhat limited.  Really your only options are the 3 oshi rolls, 3 more standard rolls plus about 10 nigiri options.  So if you are looking for the more typical 15-20 standard and specialty rolls plus a full nigiri/sashimi offering this is not the place for you.",8/27/2019,4 star rating

1154,Sanaz J.,"Vancouver, BC","Having visited their sister restaurant Minami in Yaletown, I was looking forward to checking this place out. Upon arrival, I was impressed by the friendly staff who took care of my wet jacket and umbrella as a torrential downpour was happening outside.I was seated in the side lounging area while waiting for the rest of my party to arrive. I would have to say the ambience is casual and the decor is nice. There wasn't a memorable item of furniture that caught my eye but overall the seat was comfortable. The noise level in this area was quite high even though the place was half empty.Our server was very knowledgable about the menu and we started off with a couple of Miso soups that are served without a spoon...so get ready to sip from the bowl!We ordered the Sashimi Platter, which was a selection of tuna, yellowfin and salmon. I would say the fresh fish is amazing here so can't go wrong with ordering lots of sashimi. We also picked two of their specialty sushi rolls, Miku roll was amazing but the other roll was just ordinary so not worth mentioning. For dessert we shared a parfait cake with layers of pistachio, raspberry accompanied by sour cherries and a stracciatella gelato. Needless to say this concluded the meal the best possible way.The service was amazing and with a million dollar view of the harbour I shall be back to tantalize my taste buds again and again.",11/12/2014,4 star rating
1155,Michelle S.,"Calgary, AB","Blown by reviews and ratings but not as great as it looks.Place is phenomenal but customer service is not so nice. Totally believe that customer service carries a big factor in a customer's total dinning experience. The hostess that assist us to our table seems like she doesn't want to work. knowing we did make a reservation, the hostess seems surprised and not too welcoming to us. All the servers seemed in a hurry all the time and not making us feel comfortable staying in there.We ordered calamari and edamame for appies, Red Wave roll, Chef's featured specialty roll (named something with cherry blossom) and ebi oshi for our main entree. The food is alright (customer service played a big part). Found it too pricey for the service and food that we experienced.Overall, I would not recommend this place if you want to experience an A service.",4/16/2015,2 star rating
1156,Ric M.,"San Diego, United States","This is one of those very few rare instances where five stars is just not enough. I love sushi, and Miku is so freaking good, it may have ruined my ability to eat it anywhere else. Everything we had, from the fluffy, tender, lightly battered tempura shrimp appetizer, to the pressed and unbelievably savory sushi (which really is from another world, I would guess the planet Delicious), to the freshest nigiri ( the seared albacore belly is a must). It was just an incredible experience in every facet, no flaws I could find. Our server was knowledgeable, helpful, charming and professional, I mean they even had a great (and reasonable) wine list.  I could go on for a long time on this one, but I will wrap it up by saying if you visit Vancouver and don't eat here, you blew it, so go back ASAP. We're going to for sure!",7/16/2017,5 star rating
1157,J P.,"La Mirada, United States","The food was good, but different. Miku specializes Aburi style, which uses flames to sear the fish. I prefer more traditional sushi (nigiri). The traditional sushi cut at Miku was very average and not impressive. I believe the cut and quality of the sushi is more important than sauces and methods. Overall the food was good, with nice ambience and attentive service, though trendy and more like a sushi factory.",11/11/2017,3 star rating
1158,Basil N.,"Vancouver, BC","Definitely one of the best places in Vancouver to get sushi in my opinion. The restaurant is clean and has a nice decor, the view is not so bad either, but most importantly, the sushi is amazing.Quick thoughts: I recommend getting the signature selection because you get a little bit of everything. Even if you are in the mood for traditional sushi, this is definitely a place to visit, and you can just order that and skip the specialty sushi, and you will still be very happy. This place prides itself on its aburi... but they make excellent sushi all around. I have eaten here many times and never been disappointed. If feeling adventurous... order the eggplant nigiri or an ebi nigiri and have the optional fired shrimp's head that comes with itHIghlight dishes: Ebi oshi sushi, eggplant role, salmon nigiri (nothing can beat a well done nigiri)A word on the aburi... it is their specialty and they seem to do it well. While I do love traditional sushi and that is usually what I order... I implore you to try the aburi. It is when the fish, whether nigiri or sashimi, is flame seared with some form of sauce. It is different, but very very good. It may not satisfy your sushi carving... but it will hit another spot and you will not be disappointed. I always order the miku signature selection because you get a little bit of everything... including traditional nigiri...We came here as a group of 4. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Our server was very helpful and pleasant. We started with the ebi fritters, which was really good... nothing special... but very solidWe also got the aburi sashimi selection... now that was very special and we loved it. It is a chef's selection of sashimi that is flame seared. We got a tuna, salmon and scallop piece. All very very good.We ordered a miku signature selection. This is a ten pieces: 3 aburi sushi, 3 traditional nigiri, 2 pieces from a roll and two aburi oshi sushi. I like this because it gives you a little bit of everything. If you are very hungry you will need to order something else. We went with an ebi oshi sushi... which was my favorite specialty sushi.We also explored a little bit. If you order an ebi nigiri... they will deep fry the head and that is interesting. I did not like it the first time I tried it... but after a couple of times it is something that I really enjoy now.The eggplant sushi is very interesting and hard to describe. It is excellent. We loved it, and it is not what one would expect... I love eggplant so I found this piece to be very nice.Off course... It is very hard to beat a well done salmon or tuna traditional nigiri... and since they make it very well here... I think it deserves a special mention...",7/31/2016,5 star rating

1162,Michael C.,"Renfrew-Collingwood, Vancouver, BC","Miku Restaurant has quickly risen as my favourite restaurant in Vancouver.  Authenticity, quality, ambience, cleanliness and customer experience are all 5-star. My last visit stands out specifically for the staff's willingness to go above and beyond to make my visit a great one. My reservation had to change multiple times, but you would never know it from the consistent temperament of the hostesses. Carmen in particular was extremely friendly and accommodating when taking my calls to rearrange my dinner plans.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the entire staff seemed to greet my guest and I in unison. We felt like celebrities. While the food has always been exceptional, my AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib was earth shatteringly great. This was soul food by any definition. The meat was cooked to perfection (medium rare), seasoned masterfully and accompanied by the perfect combination of sides. Miku is an exercise in decadence that I reserve for those special occasions, or as reward for some personal or professional achievement. Till the next time, I will fantasize about that prime rib in my dreams.",3/10/2015,5 star rating

The aburi was so full of taste and every bite was savoury. I loved the entire experience and the waiters are very friendly here. This is definitely a place to come for special occasions or date nights because it was a very memorable place to eat!

1178,Ben W.,"Beltline, Calgary, AB","My friend and I went to Miku to celebrate my belated birthday. I've never been to their sister-restaurant Minami in Yaletown, but I have been to Octopus' Garden in Kits several times. I can say that the sushi quality is similar to OG, though not quite as intimate a dining experience.Miku's Waterfront location is absolutely gorgeous with huge windows that look out to the water and a nifty wrap-around patio that encircles the restaurant. This is a great spot for a date or for when friends visit town. The interior space is quite open. My friend told me she felt it was more casual and family-friendly when compared to the dark / hipstery interior of Minami. The open kitchen concept does add to the noise level so keep this in mind.We both ordered the premium aburi nigiri sampler. This contained 7 pieces for almost thirty bucks. One doesn't go to these restaurants (the most hip and well-regarded in the city) looking to get a cheap bite. It is better not to think about how much each individual bite costs as it is not worth it. We also split the ebi fritters (fried shrimp). The nigiri was delicious and well-prepared. Each piece is paired with a signature Miku sauce. Of course you will likely be done eating your food in 3 minutes, but when the sushi is this good you might not care.",10/23/2014,3 star rating

Would not consider this the best sushi in Vancouver, as there are many restaurants with fresher seafood and better value, but is definitely a must-try.

1182,Roger W.,"Vancouver, BC","Very mediocre.Sushi is about magnified simplicity. Miku's sushi was overly complex with a variety of additional ingredients, and all the flavors were diminished as a result.Ebi Fritter for appetizer. This was good.Charashi Tart entree for my friend. This was good as well.Miku Zen entree for me. This was a chef's choice of a sushi and small dish combination. Sadly, none of the sushi pieces had any impact and all of them were quite bland. The small dishes were quite bland as well. The Aburi Oshi (our waiter said people would come just for this) is not something I would drive more than 10 minutes for.Sake Flight for drinks. Three types of sake selected by a ""sake specialist"". The sake were all smooth and flavorful.

I was in town just for the weekend from Chicago, and really wanted sushi and a view while I waited for my friends' flights to land.The view is beautiful and the food is amazing. I sat at the bar in the middle of the restaurant since it was just me. The service was decent and then great as one person rolled off a shift and my servers switched out. Being alone and knowing the first person saw I had a book out to read, I don't mind much that they didn't come by often.I chose the premier lunch (12 pre-determined pieces), tea, and the Green Tea Opera. The lunch was amazing - the aburi sushi was so well thought out. I've always been at sushi restaurants, even in Tokyo, where they serve the sushi with that glob of wasabi and a dish of soy sauce. I love the fact the chefs determined which pieces would have what (a little wasabi between the fish and rice, some soy dribbled underneath the rice, etc) and every piece was so well balanced.The Green Tea Opera. Sigh. I could have had five of these and been perfectly happy. It's sweet but not too sweet, with a good balance of matcha, chocolate ganache, and azuki bean cream (with a bit of crunch in each bite). I'm a sucker for crunch in food since it seems more satisfying that way.If I didn't live a 5 hour flight from here, I'd probably go once a month.",2/15/2017,5 star rating

Highlights for us:- Calamari ~ perfect texture- Salmon Oshi Suchi ~ their signature pressed sushi, nice fatty flavor without being overpowering- Red Wave Roll ~ NOM- Aburi Pearl ~ one of my favorite cocktails I've had... delicious!- Green Tea Opera ~ OMGGreat service, great food, great location (for us in at the convention center). Everyone was floored. :)",4/18/2016,5 star rating
1206,Kevin S.,"Vancouver, BC","Very disappointed, last night I ordered Kaiseki for myself and Aburi for my girlfriend as a set menu. I had two of her nigiris and while I ate the first one, there was a big fish bone. The second one also had 2 smaller fish bones. This is very dangerous and I believe the chefs are inexperienced. I wasn't going to write a review after they had compensated me a little bit. But my girlfriend had food poisoning in the middle of the night, diarrhea and cold sweat. This was a birthday dinner and I am extremely unhappy after spending at least $300 on this dinner. Expected more and never returning again.",1/29/2018,1 star rating

1208,David M.,"Burnaby, BC","What an experience. Went there for the first time in August for my birthday after hearing the hype of the place. Service was really good our server was very polite and his knowledge on the foods was a nice touch compared to other places. The food was as expected for the price very good, it didn't all blow me away and maybe I am to blame for not being able to fully appreciate sushi like others. But none the less, from start to finish I really enjoyed the experience of tasting expensive sushi!!",10/20/2016,4 star rating
1209,KJ B.,"Houston, United States","So, I can't quite sort out my feelings about Miku. Food is quite good, service outstanding, pricing right in line with what one should expect at an upscale Japanese restaurant in a major city - in fact we were pleasantly surprised by the bill.  The aburi oshi sushi was certainly worth trying, and I'd order the mackerel version again. Kale was delicious, Brussels sprouts were good, though I'd only order them again with a larger party, as it was too much for two people.  Nigiri sushi was portioned well, but not outstanding otherwise. The sake selection was perfect, with enough range to fit all tastes and budgets but not so much as to be overwhelming. In short, I think if you're fortunate enough to have regular access to great restaurants of this type, this one will not stand out. Having said that, it doesn't fall short in any category, and it would be tough not to enjoy an evening at Miku.",6/27/2018,4 star rating

1216,Ferdinand H.,"Baltimore, United States","Nouveau Japonaise?It's always hard for me to review places establishments - Japanese establishments - that aren't hard-core traditional.That said, Miku, and its sister restaurant Minami have verve and the creativity to pull off the experimentation.The decor at both restaurants is chic, modern with a dash of industrial flair.  The space is cavernous, as far as mall spaces go, high ceilings and concrete surfaces... but this also results in acoustic reverberations that can be a bit distracting to those with a preference for quiet dining.Indeed, the atmosphere is shy of raucous, but thoroughly lounge.",8/8/2014,4 star rating

The way they make their food is really interesting. I would definitely recommend trying it because it's something I personally have never tried before. Also I would suggest putting your name in then walking around because there is almost always a wait for dinner. I walked by the restaurant multiple times and saw people waiting. The service was great. Everyone was really nice. We sat at the bar and a guy in a blue suit was giving the guy next to us some great suggestions. He's an awesome server. Deserves a raise I'd say lol.

Their signature sushi is amazing,  however my date the last time wasn't a fan of the taste that the torch imparted so I guess that's subjective.  OH! They have SAKI FLIGHTS which I loved.  And plum wine flights.

1230,Jonathan C.,"Vancouver, BC","A solid 4.5/5.  Yes the food is pricey but is it worth it?  Considering a good majority of the sushi places in Vancouver are, it doesn't come as any surprise.  I've been here for both lunch and dinner and they've both been very good.  The set lunch special of sablefish is delicious. Perfectly cooked, not overly salty and the fattiness is balanced well with the accompanying sides. Dinner is excellent as well. Of all the ebi tempura dishes I've had I would say their jumbo ebi prawns are probably the best. The assorted sashimi was fresh with an assortment of fish other than salmon/tuna.  While I wasn't a fan of all their sushi rolls, more my palette preferences than the taste itself, they were nicely made with even spreading of ingredients. The sushi rice was well vinegared, still warm, and had the right ratio of outside to filling. The aburi sushi was excellent compared to a few others I've had as well.  The ambience is nice though loud, but luckily we were able to secure the private room each time. Service was always friendly and definitely didn't have any air of arrogance.  It is downtown coal harbour so parking is a factor but where isn't these days?  But if you get a window seat during a summer sunset it's absolutely gorgeous. If you want to go for a fancy date or are catering to some special out of town guests I would definitely recommend this place. if not for dinner, then the cheaper lunch sets won't break the bank.",1/7/2019,5 star rating

My friend commented that the salmon aburi style sushi was like a sushi version of a delicious truffle burger, rich and juicy, a little saucy and SO good.The cocktails were delicious and the sake selection was perfect. The ambiance is a little dressed up and dramatic for my taste, and some of our table neighbors seemed to be celebrating a special night out or a birthday. I saw a lot of tiny dresses atop wobbly legs on sky high heels...and dapper suits.

The blow torch technique to the salmon sushi with jalapeño. It was heaven and i rationed it so that it was the last thing I tasted. Literally ate it a half a bite at a time so that I could savor every last bite. It had the a thin layer of caramelized cooked salmon and then raw salmon underneath.

Located on the waterfront, this place was packed just after 6pm on a Thursday evening. Our suggestions would be to start with the Indigo Winds Sake (it's light, crisp and a little bubbly). The Soba Pepperoncino was a great spicy start along with Kale Goma-ae (sauteed kale with sesame--YUM. Make sure you save room for the BEST sushi I've ever had: Salmon Oshi Sushi! OUTSTANDING.

1250,Richard S.,"Vancouver, BC","Honestly, just not as good as its sister restaurant Minami over in Yaletown. I've been to that location enough that I don't need much time with the menu. Miku has an almost duplicate menu.The same food isn't as good. The calimari is more bland and missing sauce. The aburi sushi isn't as flavourful. I was surprised.Maybe they trade taste for the view. Go to Minami instead if you want the food not the scenery.",8/10/2014,3 star rating
1251,Steven L.,"Vancouver, BC","It was a birthday dinner last Wednesday and Miku was voted as the place. Having been to the sister restaurant Minami a few weeks prior, I knew I was going to be drawing up a lot of comparisons. Miku is wonderfully located next to Canada place occupying the spot that was once Aqua Riva - Parking was a nightmare though. It's beautifully decorated in white and blue with touches of Asian décor here and there - I think it's they're going for a modern and sophisticated yet traditional type of feel. There were panoramic windows with views of Canada place and the Pan Pacific next door. The lighting was dim and had a lounge-type feel to it with a lively fun atmosphere. (Miku wins for ambience). Between 5 of us, we ended up sharing a bunch of sushi dishes:Dish #1 - Red Wave roll: Very tasty but the rice tasted just a tad stale. That was the case for just this roll. One of my favorites at both Miku and Minami Dish #2 - Miku Roll:  Also very tasty and would recommend it. Ingredients were very fresh.Dish #3 - Premium Nigiri: Chef's mix of 7 different pieces. Mostly common fish like salmon, tuna, ebi, and scallops. Dish #4 - Salmon oshi aburi: Excellent! Very tasty and well seared. Highly recommendDish #5 - Ebi Oshi Aburi Sushi: Just as good as the salmon oshi. 6 Pieces of pressed sushi with lightly seared prawns, lime zest, and ume sauce. It's actually very saucy on top.Dish #6 - Salmon, Tuna, and Albacore Sashimi: Came with 6 pieces of each in a wonderfully presented dish. Fish quality was excellent and tasted amazing.Dish #7 - King Roll: This was just okay. After the oshi aburi dishes, this one was a little overshadowed.Dish #8 - Coal Harbor Roll: Again, just okay. This was still very tasty but compared to the other items, it didn't really stand out.Food-wise, the fish quality and taste are excellent. The dishes are well-presented with a variety of items on the menu. Although Miku and Minami's menus are about 80% identical, Minami takes this one by a hair. You can't go wrong with either place though.Our waitress was friendly but didn't come around as often as I would have liked. There were a few times where our water wasn't refilled for a while but it wasn't a big deal. Service was good but it didn't really stand out. (Minami wins for service) Overall, Miku is a solid choice for excellent sushi - we'll definitely be back.",4/11/2014,4 star rating

1263,Willow Y.,"East Side, Vancouver, BC","I tried Miku for the first time today, and I was so blown away that I actually created an account on Yelp just to review them. To give some context, I wanted to take my mom to Miku for her birthday, but she's been suffering from a prolonged bout of illness and was too tired to leave the house. Fortunately Miku did have a pick up for most of their menu items. The service was just exceptional. The person I contacted for ordering pickup, Aaron, was extremely courteous and helpful, and even included a free Green Tea Opera Cake in my order. As for the food, I had the Aburi Sashimi Selection, the popular Salmon Oshi Aburi, the Ebi Oshi Aburi, the Saba Oshi Aburi, and the Miku Roll. Aburi Sashimi Selection: 3/5; pretty good, but not exception and I don't think is worth the $23 price for 6 piecesSaba Oshi Aburi: 2/5; had a slightly weird, fishy taste and was probably the only thing that I didn't enjoyEbi Oshi Aburi: 4/5Salmon Oshi Aburi: 5/5; absolutely delicious, as good as everyone says it isMiku Roll: 5/5; my mom thought that it was the best roll that she's ever had, and I'm surprised that not more people are raving about itGreen Tea Opera Cake: 5/5; practically any good cake is an automatic 4/5 for me, and this one was just gorgeous.

Ebi Fritter white tiger prawns, herb beer battered, sweet chili aioli,soy-balsamic reduction, chili powder-when this came out, it look like it would be really bland, but it was seasoned very well and the batter was light, but still crispy.Aburi Beef Carpaccio sterling silver AAA short rib, tamari horseradish crème fraîche, 64° organic egg, jalapeño-garlic ponzu, organic baby greens-the egg is what makes it taste that much better. Hamachi Sashimi Salad aburi yellowtail, artichoke-green olive relish, yuzu-avocado purée, organic baby greens-super fresh. Just melts in your mouthPan Seared Alaskan Scallops market fresh orange, watercress, frisée, crème fraîche, yuzu puttanesca-a little on the smaller side, but it was seared perfectly.Shabu Shabu AAA sterling silver beef short rib, wild arugula, daikon, carrot, udon, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, house made ponzu-your own personal shabu. I wish they gave more noodles. Broth is very good and the meat is good quality.Salmon Oshi Sushi pressed BC wild sockeye salmon, jalapeño, miku sauce-I never had sushi like this. This was small rectangle pieces of rice with salmon, jalapeno, and sauce on top, but in between the rice there is a piece of salmon. I have never seen that before. It was super, super yummy. I want more now!Ebi Oshi Sushi pressed prawn, lime zest, ume sauce-this was just as good, but I like the salmon morePremium Aburi chef's selection feature seafood, each paired with a unique house made sauce, lightly flame seared aburi style-I ordered this for my entree and it was really good. The rice was made well and some had a nice torch to it. Some of the fishes, I don't think it went well with the sauces or they put a little too much of it and it over powers the fish. 5 hour Slow Roasted Prime Rib AAA sterling silver, brown butter wasabi sauce, market vegetables, yukon potato purée baked with iwa-nori butter-amazing! Super tender and flavorful. The potatoes were really good too, but the bad thing is that they don't have any rice for you. They only have the rice they make sushi with, which is all seasoned with stuff. How odd. I want to come back and try more things.",4/15/2014,4 star rating

The unique preparation and seasoning of the sushi (no soy sauce necessary) made for such a memorable meal. Salmon aburi is DELICIOUS and a must-order. Also loved the Miyazaki #2 cocktail.

1268,Mark T.,"Philadelphia, United States","We went to Miku last night for a special occasion.  It was my first time visiting.I want to write a glowing review, because all the food was very good.  However, the service was very detrimental to the experience.  We started with a 20minute wait past our reservation time.  At one point, there were 5 or 6 greeters/servers at the greeting station in what seemed like total chaos.Then, we ordered 2 drinks and 2 appetizers.  We ate the first app and the second app arrived before our drinks.  Very annoying.  We also ordered the bouillabaisse (for two, $58) which featured prawnS, scallopS, fish, clams, mussels.  The single prawn and single scallop were very good.  However, there were exactly one of each.  We finished the bouillabaisse and were still hungry.  We asked the waitor if that was really the ""for two"" serving.  He informed us there was only one size.  We then got the menu, and ordered more food.  Obviously, he put our order in wrong, bc there was clearly a ""for two"" option.  Luckily, we only paid for ""for one, $29""  In any case, please change the description to reflect that you will only barely get one scallop and prawn.  As the night got later, we asked the waiter to put the heat lamps on.  We were told, ""no problem.""  They were never put on.Total bizzare dinner.  I'd be very upset if I were the chef.  Great food, miserable service.",8/9/2014,2 star rating

1274,Doug P.,"Kirkland, United States","I was in Vancouver for a conference and tried Miku for the first time. Conveniently located next to the convention center and waterfront, MIku is a beautifully designed modern sushi restaurant. On a nice day you can sit on the patio and take in the beautiful mountains in the distance. The host staff seemed a little  less happy to be there but the serving staff and bartenders were extremely friendly and conversational. I enjoyed my dinner so much that I ended up coming back that week for another dinner. One night I dined on the patio and the next time at the bar. Both times I received excellent service. I tried the oysters, Miku Signature selection, and a mix of the Nigiris. Everything was well prepared and plated. It was a solid meal. I highly recommend Miku if you are in the area. It does get busy in the evening though, so if you plan on dining without a reservation, you want to get there around 4PM.",5/11/2016,4 star rating

1279,Nancy W.,"Port Coquitlam, BC","Miku Restaurant Vancouver Downtown is located where Aqua Riva once was at Granville Square. This high-profile waterfront location is lovely with a great view of Five Sails. Miku Restaurant is founded by Seigo Nakamura, sister restaurant to Minami Yaletown; and has been known as the place to go for Aburi sushi. Aburi sushi (flame seared) consists of nigiri sushi with a party seared, partly raw fish toppings. For those that know me well, understand that I love Japanese food. I can probably eat sushi all day errday! Miku is a great place for girls night or date night. The space includes an open kitchen main dining area and a quieter more intimate back room with water view.Miku Casesar: well spiced, rimmed and savored.French 75: A bubbly classic of gin, fresh lemon, simple syrup, sparkling wine, lemon twist.Sashimi Platters from $20 / person. Please ask your server for details as selection varies daily. Today special was Botan Ebi spot prawn, Hotate scallops, Hamachi Yellow Tail, Wild Sockeye Salmon, Tuna, Maguro Red Tuna, and a medley of diced tuna with garlic sauce. The heads of the botan spot prawn can be deep fried after you are done. The value and the quality of this platter was pretty decent. Everything was very fresh and good sized.Aburi Beef Carpaccio 18: sterling silver AAA short rib, tamari horseradish crème fraîche, ponzu, celery, organic 64° egg, organic baby greens. The sous vide egg took a few pokes to get the yolk running. The sauce was too salty and it didn't stand a chance against Phnom Penh's butter beef. Nonetheless, the beef was tender and soft. Sometimes less is more.Aburi Saba Oshi Sushi 15: pressed house cured mackerel, miso sauce. This roll was very tasty but a tad salt with the miso sauce. And I wish the saba was slightly thicker to get that texture and bite. I would still prefer the Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi!Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi 16: pressed BC wild sockeye salmon, jalapeno and miku sauce. This is one of my favorite aburi rolls. I love the spiciness and the slight crunch of the jalapeno against the freshness of the fish. I clearly remember that one piece of this from the Minami Dine Out Menu, simply was not enough.MIKU Roll 18: salmon, crab, cucumber, sea urchin, rolled in flying fish roe, miku sauce. The miku sauce used here is the same sauce used in the Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi. The roll is gently torched and the roe are half cooked. Like popping bubble wrap and tobiko pop rocks in your mouth. I definitely prefer the a la carte more since we get to have more of what we love! Hope you enjoy the view!",3/28/2014,4 star rating

1290,Alexandra S.,"Vancouver, BC","My favorite sushi anywhere, and one of my favorite Vancouver restaurants. The salmon oshi roll is a religious experience. But if you're visiting Miku for the first (or fiftieth) time, you can't go wrong with the Miku Zen lunch -- three courses, including miso soup, a 4-appetizer bento box (really a  meal in itself) followed by a plate of their most awesome sushi. Note that Miku isn't just a better version of your regular sushi place -- they do a lot of oshi (seared) sushi, and lots of it with interesting sauces. If you like your sushi totally plain you will still find just some lovely cuts of fish, but what makes it special are all their unusual preparations.Also note that Miku defies the usual rule that a great view means lousy food. In addition to fabulous food, it's a beautiful room with a spectacular oceanside view.",5/20/2014,5 star rating
1291,Yo M.,"Oakland, United States",Everything people say is true. One of a kind experience. The whole thing is exceptional - from the hostess station all the way until the cashier experience... just superb. Never had better seafood in North America.

1292,Kiana W.,"Port Moody, BC","Exceptional service. Miku has the absolute best service for a fine dining Japenese restaurant. When you first walk in you are greeted by the hostesses as well as the kitchen. It's quite a friendly atmosphere and you can really feel the genuine passion that the kitchen has for food and cooking. It's amazing. Now let's get to the food. I have never in my life had sushi as good as Miku. Although the menu is a little hard to understand if you don't know what traditional Japanese food is called or looks like. But I guarantee anything you order will be good. During my visit, I ordered the Aburi Chirashi Tart, Aburi Salmon, and Green Tea Ice Cream. All items were exquisite and delectable. The rice on both Aburi Chirashi Tart and Aburi Salmon was so soft, smooth, and literally melts in your mouth, not even kidding. The Green Tea Ice Cream used real matcha which I could taste. Everything I had ordered was just amazing. All the ingredients were fresh and well seasoned. Since my first visit, I've gone back there a few times. Although the prices are quite high I would say this would definitely be a restaurant to splurge at, at least once. I would also recommend booking a reservation in advance to be guaranteed a seat and not a long wait. 10/10 would recommend.",8/3/2018,5 star rating

1296,Yisha Z.,"Los Angeles, United States","I'm an Asian who've had lots and lots of sushi in Japan, Taiwan, Shanghai and the States. But the sushi here at Miku really surprised me! When we were planning the trip, my coworkers and friends gave me lots of recos, mostly the popular ones -- Rodney's, Blue Water, and Medina. Nobody mentioned Miku. So when my friend said her boss recommended Miku, I was a bit skeptical. But it turned out to be reeeally good.The Aburi Oshi Sushi was the real bomb! We got half an order of salmon and half an order of saba. I guess it was the flame that made the grease in the fish meat lead out onto the rice, or the secretive Miku sauce, making the rice exude a unique fragrance. I also liked how the chef hid another piece of sashimi in the rectangle rice, making the small piece of sushi having multiple layers. It's definitely not the traditional, textbook way of sushi making, it's not the American-way of cooked sushi either. It's somewhere in-between. It hit a nice sweat spot--innovative, but is delicate and attentive enough to be respectful to traditional sushi making. We also ordered Aburi Beef Carpaccio. Paper-think raw beef plus raw eggs? Heaven!Considering the USD to CAD exchange right now, a nice dinner at Miku is basically a steal.Upon returning to the US., I recommended Miku to all my coworkers who had frequented Vancouver but havd never been to Miku. I will definitely go there again when I'm in Vancouver. Hopefully they will open up a restaurant in LA one day!",1/24/2016,5 star rating

1299,John P.,"Toronto, ON","Tough experience with this place tonight. I was seated quickly (without a reservation) and my first server took a drink order while I read over the menu. A different server brought me my drink and took a small, preliminary sushi order. Then I waited. And waited. A third server eventually noticed me and asked if I'd ordered any food yet. I said I had. Then I waited some more. The better part of forty-five minutes passed without my order ever appearing. I can only assume it was never passed on to the kitchen. I finally asked to settle my drink bill so I could leave. It was comped and the third server apologized. But I left hungry and more than a little embittered.

Even the rice was different - almost creamy, but not. The mackerel was a little salty for me, but still delicious nonetheless. My favorite was the salmon sushi - with a tiny piece of jalapeño in the center, it was the perfect seasoning.

1318,Melanie G.,"Burnaby, BC","We went to Miku for a surprise birthday party.  There were about 15 of us.  We had reserved a private room at the back of the restaurant.  When we were booking they provided us with 2 set menu options.  One for $68 and the other for $88.  The group decided on the $68 menu.  Our meal was composed of 4 courses.  A starter with 4 small bites; beef carpaccio, salmon aburri, a tuna bit and a scallop.  It looked pretty but I wasn't that impressed with the flavours.  I think the beef could have been sliced thinner and more rare too.  The second course was the main dish.  We had 2 options, prime rib or black cod.  I chose the black cod and was very impressed!  It was a sizeable piece and cooked really well.  It just felt apart!  My boyfriend ordered the prime rib.  He was impressed too but felt it could have been bigger.  The next course was a sushi platter.  I liked this dish too.  My favourite piece was the oshi salmon.  This was followed with dessert.  It was a ginger chocolate cake.  This was only okay for me but i'm not generally a big dessert person.  We also added the ebi fritter appy and oyster shot to start.  The ebi fritter dish was really good.  I didn't enjoy the oyster shot that much.  It was soy based with sesame seed oil.  I liked the oil but it was too salty for me.  My fav oyster shot is still from Pidgin.",1/14/2016,4 star rating

The Salmon however is a mile better than the Saba with an interesting smoked taste to it. We also ordered the Prime Rib which had a Japanese flavour to it, quite interesting fusion touch. Surprised to have a good Prime Rib at a Fusion Japanese restaurant. Minus one star for its price, just because similar quality food can be found elsewhere in Vancouver as well.

They're related and it shows but one shines brighter, depending on who you ask. If you're asking me, keep reading. If not, continue Yelping.I liked Miku - she's a little classier and a lot more high maintenance. Those aren't bad things.Soba Pepperoncino: Better than Minami's soba. So many textures, flavours, and subtle heat.Aburi Beef Carpaccio: A PERFECTLY poached egg. PERFECT.It glazed all over the beef - as good as gold.Pan Seared Alaskan Scallops: Large, plump, and precisely cooked with a fresh complement of watercress and frisee. Of course no meal at these restaurants is complete without aburi sushi. It was a little sloppy (too much rice) but I don't fault them because it's still delicious and a best I ever ate.We ended dinner with dessert and it was phenomenal. I recommend the blueberry lime tart. We took our cue from the server and she was right. Every bit (blueberry compote, cassis, green apple gelee, lavender reduction, white-chocolate juniper quenelle) played its part and worked so well with the chamomile-yogurt sorbet.I don't think I can throw enough superlatives at this place. It's a high end restaurant worth its weight in dollars. The food is elevated, the service is fantastic, and the view of the harbour (even with the tankers) is beautiful.",5/10/2014,4 star rating

The hostess station is clearly staffed with people that have no service industry experience. They say you only have one chance at making a first impression, So in this instance Miku failed dramatically. Can't even speak to the food because the initial service was so shockingly horrible. We arrived early for our reservation, which apparently doesn't mean anything at Miku, only to be treated as if we hadn't planned on spending nearly $500 for dinner. Save your money and go elsewhere. I will make a concerted effort to tell everyone I know to avoid this place.",11/9/2017,1 star rating

1343,Isabella L.,"Toronto, ON","They're a 3.7 really.On a my trip to Vancouver, my girlfriend and I decided to treat my grandma and auntie to a nice restaurant, and since my grandma likes seafood, I decided to pick Miku. Atmosphere: Chic white interior surrounded by young adults. Lots of conversation going on. Very friendly, knowledgeable and cool-lookin' staff. I was very hesitant when I looked at the menu 'cause it was fusion and I was thinkin' to myself... ''sigh... here we go''. Well, there were hits and misses.Food: H I T S:Aburi Sashimi & Premium Nigiri - pretty much the same dishes, but one has rice and the other doesn't. the fish was fresh, but i didn't really like the whole fusion fiasco goin' on. they serve a variety of fish and it is slightly seared to release the oils. quite tasty.Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi & Aburi Saba Oshi SushiThese guys were the star of the show. It is basically rectangular shaped sushi, but the fish and the rice was extremely fresh. An extremely tasty dish that MUST be ordered when you go there!Hamachi SashimiAbsolutely fresh and delicious. Great quality. Period.M I S S E S:Una-Kyu Roll - BBQ eel (unagi) with teriyaki sauce or there own creation sauce of some sort. I was not pleased with this dish at all. It just was not the traditional unagi roll, and I'm not being a traditionalist, but the sauce wasn't even. MHM. Skip this one.Kaisen Soba PepperoncinoThis is what I meant when I sighed to myself and thought of fusion food. They put arugala and soba noodles with raw tomatoes. Yeah, that's like some desperate dish only a vegetarian running out of options would think of. Please, please PLEASE skip. It was the biggest portion of food that we got though.Overall: I'd come back, but only for their sushi and sashimi. Everything else was mediocre and overpriced at best. Overhyped as well.

1351,Lisa O.,"East Side, Vancouver, BC","First I would like to state...I don't like sushi. Crazy to find myself rating a restaurant that primarily serves sushi but that is because Miku has changed my relationship with sushi forever!  When my son first recommended this place I said a resounding ""No"", however I was out voted, so begrudgingly I went. It didn't start off great, as the hostesses are not very friendly (unless they know you, they appear stuck up), but that is no reason to knock a star off the rating as you only have to deal with those ladies for a few minutes (and trust me I have since been back to Miku several times and every time they are the same).  Anyway back to the Miku experience. The waitress we had was AMAZING. She helped turn this girl into a sushi (cooked only-no raw fish for me) lover!  I explained to her my issue with sushi, I don't like a fishy taste, so no seaweed or roe or raw fish, hmmm I guess that narrows out all sushi...so I thought but oh no!  She introduced me to Ebi, and fritters as well as an amazing shrimp ( biggest shrimp ever) cocktail. Everyone else at my table ate the traditional type of sushi and raved about it, but I stuck to my ebi. It was a rectangle of sticky rice with a thin layer of prawn and some sort of creamy sauce and a hint of lime perfectly covering the top of the rice. The first bite my taste buds woke up and said a big Hello!  It was heaven in a bite, too amazing to describe as there are no words that could ever convey and define the experience I was having.  The portion size was perfect, just enough to fill you up but delicious enough to have you wanting more...meaning we need another reservation!  We did also enjoy some amazing deserts...we order everyone they had (our group was fairly large) and everyone was beautifully presented and again another piece of ecstasy. Once it was all said and done I thanked my son for the recommendation. If you cancel out the hostesses, everyone and everything at Miku was perfect!  The ambience, the view of coal harbour, the lighting (yes I just said that), watching the chefs work in the back, the lovely waitress, the gentlemen who brought us our food, and then of course the food!  PERFECT!  As previously mentioned we have returned several times and each time is the same as the first, so give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Now I caution you; they do have a sister restaurant in Yale Town called Minami.  They serve some of the same food, but it is presented differently, the ambience is NOT the same, even the prices are different. We tried it once, but after going to Miku going to Minami was a huge disappointment. It is like Miku is the gorgeous sister and Minami is the frumpy wall flower...with some work she could be beautiful, but she definitely needs some work!  I hope this review helps you in your decision about where to eat. If you do try Miku, get a reservation. Walking in without one expect to wait up to an hour or even be turned away by those hostesses. Good luck and enjoy!",5/31/2017,5 star rating

This restaurant will let you order half rolls which is a great way to share and taste all the different sushi they have to offer. The Miku roll was delicious, but our favorite roll was the Salmon Oshi which we were told was what put this place on the map....we loved it so much we ordered a second Salmon Oshi roll instead of dessert!

They treated me like a king, and the quality of everything they brought me was fresh, smooth and delicious. I spent a lot and everything they brought me felt like it was worth the cost.It's not a place you can visit frequently given the cost, but I absolutely plan to come back whenever I can (... maybe with a reservation and dressed a little better, though).

1357,Thomas P.,"Vashon, United States","Hands down one of the top 3 sushi experiences I've had - everything was exquisite and the service was white glove-top notch-intimate.  While this is a fancy restaurant that sets high expectations for itself and its product, it is by no means stuffy or stuck up.  We walked in on a busy Saturday with no reservations and wearing jeans, and were treated like regulars who had been 100 times.  The only thing I would not recommend is the ""house specialty"" flame-seared sushi (which the staff clearly has a mandate to suggest/push).  It was the only thing mediocre and was 80% rice.  Also, the ""ocean friendliness"" is a bit overstated here, as there are a few sustainable options but certainly not an ethos of sustainability.",11/19/2016,5 star rating

1368,Drew L.,"Vancouver, BC","Allow me to start of that Vancouver's sushi and Japanese culture has been well established for decades, arguably since the 1960's and 70's with the birth of the California roll. Nonetheless, I would say that Vancouver's reputation for good sushi has been laggging far behind, towed by only a handful or quality restaurants over the years. Enter Miku, a relatively new restaurant with a modern, sophisticated ambiance. This is my first time dining at Miku and it was for Dine Out Vancouver. The moment our party was all there, were seated promptly to our reservation time. The service was professional and excellent, and because it was a Dine Out event, they were booked solid and we were given a very polite heads up that we had 1h 45 mins to dine and enjoy our table. The beauty of how Miku planned the Dine Out event was that the 3-course set menu has several dishes for the appetizer, the entree and one for dessert; we didn't have to decide because everything was included. I personally love this as I almost everything looked great and I wanted to try everything. The appetizer was delightful! I reviewed some earlier comments that one of the appys was basically mashed potatoes and steak.  I indeed received a two slices of AAA Sterling siliver NY steak with Yukon potato purée. I agree that 'steak n' potatoes' is not exactly original, but the the flavours were impeccable and there was a nice Japanese twist to the jus that was drizzleed on. The crab claw fritter was scrumptious. I rarely see so much crab meat packed into each claw, and fried to perfection. The steamed sake chicken breast was the least exciting of all, however, the strong and balanced flavours made it a pleasure to consume nonetheless. The salad was cheerful, refreshing, with a generally balanced favour, and used quality, fresh greens - you could taste despite the flavourful dressing.The entree consisted of samples of Miku's signature sushi.It did not look very substantial, but I must say it filled me up to a pleasant point (I didn't feel like I overate.) Each roll was seasonsed to perfect with subtle, but distinct aftertastes that were pleasant to the palate. You did not need to dip the sushi in soy sauce and you did not need to spice it up with wasabi. The rolls that demanded a touch of spice were complimented with a hint of wasabi - just right. I also personally do not like the aftertaste of toasted sesame seeds which if found all too often sprinkled on top of sushi rolls. Not here! At Miku, they crush and lightly season the exterior of select rolls with high quality seeds to givbe it texture. To my surprise, I did not experience the overwhelming, suffocating, burnt aroma or aftertaste associated with common toasted seeds. The only other time I was pleasantly surprised about sesame seeds was at the Dirty Apron, a cooking school and restaurant that sources only the finest of ingredients. Regardless, I'm love eating and as a North American, I'm always tempted to get more. This is I agree, how the restaurant makes its profit. Four of us in our group ordered two additional rolls from their regular menu. One of them was their Miku roll, which I found to be my favourite. I personally that roll was my favourite and each roll consisted of eight pieces.The price for each roll ranged between $14 and $19, a few more dollars for much higher quality. The dessert was the least extraordinary of the entire experience. It was great, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't something that blew me away. It was a Kahlua Tiramisu Verrinewalnut cinnamon nougatine cookie, that tasted like a well prepared tiramisu that was sweet, although my partner said 'too sweet', and it came in a very small glass. Flavours were of course, still balanced and there was texture. Finally, I thought the $19 sake pairing was intriguing and impressive, maybe because I don't know much about sake. So in my opinion, I enjoyed the sips of sake that seems to compliment each course really well. I am willing to hear otherwise of course.",1/23/2016,5 star rating
1369,Sally O.,"Toronto, ON","Came to visit Vancouver last week, was told I must try Miku. They did open up a location in Toronto but I haven't gotten a chance to visit yet.

I really have to say, their aburi oshi sushi is amazing. The best I have ever had. Their cooked foods were however just average in my experience. We ordered ebi shrimp and also tried their cooked chicken in sake - we were satisfied but it was underwelming.

Stepping into Miku is like stepping into a kpop concert.The service was excellent and the waiter knew the menu inside out and was very attentive.Now to the food. If you enjoy over-priced west-coast style sushi singed with a blowtorch, this place is for you. The rolls are not bad, the quality is actually very good; just different from the more traditional sushi to which I'm accustomed. Some people like that half-cooked taste. The sashimi was a bit disappointing. The sockeye salmon we ordered was mediocre, the portions were small, and was overpriced. Broadway Ebisu is far far superior in terms of sashimi. I recommend coming to this place one in a while if you enjoy eating decent sushi amongst a good looking Asian crowd.",10/19/2013,3 star rating

1376,Nina S.,"Vancouver, BC","***I've edited my review because since the last I reviewed, I have been to Miku's many, many more times and I can honestly say it's my favorite sushi/fusion place in Vancouver. I can never get sick of this place and will always go back. I will leave my previous review up just to warn people about the pricing situation. ***I've been to Miku a couple of times and I've had pretty much the same experience each time. The food is fantastic. You can't go wrong with the Ebi Aburi Sushi or the Salmon Aburi Sushi - or anything Aburi for that matter. The only ""problem"" and I say this because I know most people are hard hit in this economy is the pricing. Even though the pricing is actually not that bad for what you're getting. Especially if you have your meal out on the patio. They even offer you blankets! It's in a great location, but it's also in a very touristy location, so they charge for what they provide and it's understandable. You just have to watch out what you order, because they charge you for everything you get. My mom ordered the seaweed salad - which is awesome and delicious with a decent price - $10. And she asked our server if it was possible to get a couple of cooked shrimps on the side of it. The guy told us that would be no problem, but didn't mention how much of an additional charge it was going to be. We figured they were going to charge us an extra $5... that was wrong. Don't assume anything! They ended up charging us $12 for 4 pieces of shrimp. I thought that was pretty outrageous, considering he didn't even mention that there was going to be an additional charge, and if there is - that's fine - shouldn't you warn the people that it's going to bump up your $10 meal to a $22 meal?Other than that, the staff was friendly and accommodating and it is an experience on its own.",8/10/2014,5 star rating

1382,Jenny H.,"Irvine, United States","This review is based on the horrendous, awful, and most terrible service we received from Sabrina the assistant GM. We were in Vancouver to celebrate my best friend's bachelorette and the Shangri-La recommended Miku for our group dinner of 11 girls. Upon arrival at the restaurant, we were greeted by Sabrina who noticed the bride with her veil and sash. She immediately proceeded to warn us about any inappropriate paraphernalia we might have with us and that they would not be allowed at the table or restaurant. I assured her that we are classy girls and did not have anything with us that would be inappropriate. She then justifies her questioning by saying they have had issues with other parties before and so forth. Fast forward to getting to our table, we are enjoying the view and ourselves as it is most of the girls' first time in Vancouver. We flew from all over California to be together on this trip and dinners like this are too far and few in between, thus we are really cherishing the moment. Let me preface what I am going to say next by letting you know that this is NOT AT ALL A QUIET restaurant. There is music playing in the background, people are drinking and enjoying themselves, and you have to speak loudly to be heard across the table. I compare this to Katsuya in Hollywood. So naturally, we were talking and laughing amongst ourselves and making the bride feel special. Then comes Sabrina, who approached us with a very angry face and rude attitude, she told us that we were being too loud and if we would like to be moved to the lounge area. Apparently, we have gotten a couple complaints and people have requested to be moved (we haven't even been in the restaurant for maybe 10 mins? haven't even ordered drinks!). Are you kidding me? I would understand if this was a spa where everyone is whispering and having a zen sushi dinner, but it is not. It is a hip, loud and happening place. Sabrina continued to say more inconsiderate and rude comments IN FRONT OF THE BRIDE. This made us all extremely uncomfortable and also made the bride feel very unwelcomed. We are here for a celebration and happiness, after all! I don't know if she's new to hospitality, but that is not the way to treat your paying customers. Even if what she said was true, she could have pulled one of us aside or said to a couple us quietly instead of ruining the mood of an entire group ESPEICALLY the bride on her special night. Sabrina was condescending and disrespectful in her tone. Where is her respect for customers? After this terrible experience, the bride actually asked if we could leave. Sabrina did come later and apologized profusely but at that point, the damage has already been done. Needless to say, I will never be coming back here or any of its associated restaurants. The same feeling goes for everyone in our group.",6/30/2015,1 star rating
1383,Ekaterina V.,"New Westminster, BC","Great service, quality aburi, have never heard the ""We are out of...."" as I have at other higher end sushi restaurants. Definitely a fusion restaurant rather than authentic, so as long as you keep that in mind, you will enjoy. Some of the sushi is a bit too gimmicky, hence the 4 stars rather than 5 - in the end, you come to a sushi restaurant to taste fish, not Chef's Special Sauce - but most pieces are a hit.",12/28/2016,4 star rating
1384,Aaron C.,"Vancouver, BC","I have been here on a number of occasions, and everytime I leave incredibly pleased and full.The food is phenomenal, inventive, and tasty.  The executive chef did well!  The Aburi sushi is one of my favourite things off the menu.The atmosphere is also awesome.  This is quite a busy and loud place, but it certainly has a working-professional atmosphere.  The patio provides a stunning view of Vancouver's waterfront as well.The only complaint that I have for this place is just in regards to parking.  The restaurant is already expensive as it is; paying for parking will add a good bill to your cost of the night as well.",7/28/2014,5 star rating

1391,Thomas A.,"Chicago, United States",Beautiful restaurant with scrumptious food. It is a bit expensive but you get buck for your dollar.

1397,Marco G.,"Richmond, BC","I often have lunch at Miku Japanese restaurant.  It's a very well located and busy restaurant so highly recommend making a reservation.  The restaurant is located in Coal Harbour.  The views of the water, mountains and harbour are spectacular.  The staff in this restaurant are very well trained.  It's a smooth operating machine considering the amount of people during lunch.  My favourites sharing items on the menu are Salmon Oshi Sushi and Aburi Chirashi Tart.  For an individual order, The Aburi 8 piece plate or the premium 12 piece sushi plate are more than enough.  For some people this may be a expensive restaurant but I think it's worth the price considering the quality of the service and the food.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you desire good service, nice ambiance, and fresh sushi.",3/24/2017,5 star rating

1401,Scott S.,"Toronto, ON","Been a fan of Miku since their old location. Love their new & improved address with great views of the Vancouver harbour.This is the sister restaurant to Minami (at Yaletown). Nothing beats Miku & Minami for sushi rolls. With sushi rolls, restaurants can save a little bit of money and not use the freshest of fish, because the thick flavours of the sauces will mask the freshness anyway. Many restos take this shortcut, but not Miku & Minami. The restaurants are a tad pricey, but its a price I am willing to pay for fresh fish.The restaurants serve the rolls aburi style, ie. lightly burned with a blow torch. You can't go wrong with the Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi and Red Wave Roll.The menus at Miku & Minami are so considerably similar that it really doesn't matter where you go. However, if you want a great option found only at the Miku location, try the Aburi Chirashi Tart: a layered tower of spicy tuna, avocado, aburi salmon, prawn, scallop, flying fish roe, ikura and miku sauce!",7/22/2013,5 star rating
1402,Connie H.,"Vancouver, BC","Came here twice - once for a birthday dinner, once for lunch. The food and service never fail to exceed my expectations. The restaurant is famous for its aburi Oshi sushi - I actually love the shrimp one the most, but the salmon one is also very good. I just love sour things and the hint of lime juice won me over to the shrimp! I've also tried other sushi like the miku roll which was great, the sashimi salad, and the miku zen box only available during lunch. I would recommend you to get that since you can try a lot of diff types of food. The desserts - they are works of art!!! I had the green tea opera and a chocolate one before. Stunning and tastes amazing. I want to go back just for that. It's pricey, but it's worth it!",8/19/2013,5 star rating
1403,Claire C.,"San Jose, United States","By the time I got to the restaurant it was 3pm and they only had bar menus.  We quickly got seated.  The waiter recommended the Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi to us, so we order that and some shrimp roll and fish and chips.  Salmon Oshi Sushi came quickly and oh my, it was soooo delicious.  The shirmp roll and fish and chips were also good.  I can't wait to go back and try their regular menu next time!!",9/13/2016,4 star rating

1411,Ivy W.,"San Francisco, United States","Many people criticize Miku for its authenticity in Japanese food, and how it lacks the genuine interaction between the sushi chef and customers. To me, Miku just brings a new genre of Japanese food, a genre that we all should have access to in big cities. Salmon oshi sushis are always a must get, and I personally LOVE the bouillabaise. They really rock their hot menu items like no other. However, service did not seem very genuine, and I feel like the servers were just hounding after the tips.

I absolutely love the aburi sushi and soba pepperocino. They were so good that you don't need any additional soy sauce. Their dessert is also delicious. The bill is quite expensive for four people but the food is so good. Definitely one of my favourite restaurants.",6/11/2016,5 star rating
1414,Serena L.,"Los Altos, United States","After an afternoon of skiing up at Grouse, this place was a very good choice to end the night.The waiters were very friendly and attentive as were the sushi chefs making yummy and creative sushi in front of us.The place was very packed for Wed night but we were able to be seated without a wait at the sushi bar.We ordered the Miku Signature Selection Sushi plate which came with 10 pieces of special nigiri. It's not an easy dish to share since there is only one piece each. So we ordered 2 of them. The variety is good including the famous salmon aburi oshi and ebi aburi oshi. There was also a piece of wagyu aburi. This is definotely not your average Japanese sushi restaurant as most fish are served with house special sauce and seared. Quite tasty...The spicy gyoza was also very good.We were very fortunate that they had few pieces of hirame engawa which was yummy. The spot prawn was also very fresh and sweet.To wrap up the night we also ordered the green tea opera which was a nice green tea cake with chocolate ganache. Everything tasted fresh... We would definotely come back and try the special omakase next time...",2/5/2014,5 star rating
1415,Chris K.,"Brooklyn, United States","3.5 stars, but we'll round up for the location. The amount of Japanese tourists in here is bewildering - they are more like tourists from the States that go to McDonald's than a harbinger of quality.  When a place manages to mess up toro, you know there is a problem.  Skip the sashimi and nigiri, because, while this is a sushi restaurant, what they apparently really do well is blow-torched rolls and fried izakaya treats (chicken, prawns), which you should probably order after you hike Grouse f*cking Mountain.",8/31/2015,4 star rating

I mentioned I didn't want anything rare and one of options I was told that was cooked was actually rare I tried sending it back and it was if I asked to turn the earth in opposite direction so we just kept it and of course still got charged for it . When I mentioned something to the waiter he continued to argue with me as if I was at fault . Honestly worst experience ever . On top of that the manager low blows me by ""comping me"" half of a roll ! Mind you the whole roll is 6 pieces . Great so now I'm only able to eat  half a roll .

Miku is NOT on the same playing field as Uchi and their prices were twice as high.  Maybe the chefs were having a bad night but I found the flavors to be bland not inspired. $375 for a dinner for two that only included one $55 bottle of sake is ridiculous and this comes from a person who does not ask prices when seeking experiences.

1443,Maggi H.,"Vancouver, BC","Would I go back? Yes, if it was another complimentary dinner. ""Miku"" takes the casualness of sushi into the world of fine dining . As great as I found the ambience and food I cannot justify spending $10-28 for an appetizer or $10-17 for a sushi roll; knowing that it will come to me in a small portion, and be no where close to filling me up. I will then be forced to order more at the same steep price. You can get 3 great sushi rolls else where for the price of one here. Yes, the quality may not be as fresh and as flavourful as it is at ""Miku"", but for the value I say its worth the cheaper price elsewhere. Would I recommend it? - Yes, if you have never tried the half grill and half raw stylings of ""aburi"", I definitely suggest you don't deny yourself the pleasure. And why not go straight to the first source of it in North America?

We thought the dessert was a disappointment and heavy - we had expected a more delicate dessert to compliment the evening.The service was very attentive and the restaurant was nice, albeit loud where we sat indoors (should have opted for a patio seat). Restaurant was crowded so you bumped into people walking around. Bathrooms were nice.",7/5/2015,4 star rating
1455,Lucia Z.,"Vancouver, BC","One of my top three restaurants.Came here for a friend's birthday, and spent about $170 between the two of us. No regrets though, because we were impressed by almost every single dish. In order,Oyster shooters: as good as oysters get.Sashimi platter: one dish we regret; we should've gone with the oshi sashimis. Soba: best soba ever. Period.Salmon oshi: need I even say anything? Really worth the hype. We ordered two. Wagyu nigiri: a little overly seared for me. Won't be ordering again.Tuna belly nigiri: buttery, and really really really good.Jasmine tea ice cream: tasted more like earl grey than anything. Too strong for me.Chardonnay sorbet: the most unique sorbet ever, would go back just for that. The ice creams and dessert were presented in such an elegant bowl, decorated with a sugar waffle of some sort, and fresh fruits and mint leaves. Prettiest things ever. Raspberry almond gateau: My friend had this dish, and loved every bite of it.Kikumasamune: Not the biggest fan of sake, and a glass was a bit over the amount of alcohol I'd drink for dinner, however still would recommend 100% Overall a very nice experience. Will definitely come back. Biggest fan of their paper towels in the washrooms.",6/29/2015,5 star rating

The rolls were quite small but it just left more room to order more rolls! The service was amazing.

1462,Ce S.,"Queens, United States","It's a great fusion Japanese restaurant. That being said if you have a westerner taste / love fusion food, then this is the place to go. For those who don't like fishy sushi, this is a good place too because they balance the fish taste with sauces. However, for my Asian appetite, there is not enough authenticity. For example, I ordered their super green /matcha cake, the cake came with 7 layers. It looks sophisticated and the waiter told me that it takes a day to make. However, the nutty  taste of one layer dominates the green tee flavor, which is quite disappointing. I was expecting some cake more like the one from lady M...",2/6/2016,4 star rating
1463,satch l.,"Vancouver, BC",I use to really like this place. The flavor were good and quality was top notch. But my recent visit assured me that the quality and direction of this restaurant is not what it once was. All the food flavor was confusing and I can barely taste the original flavor of the main ingredient. Now this place reminds me of any typical over sauced and over decorative sushi restaurant. For the price if I wanted something like that I rather go to any sushi restaurant like that and pay 1/3 of the price. Sorry to say but this is is probably my last visit here. Miku.. It was good while it lasted...  Good bye.,4/13/2016,2 star rating

1475,Vicki W.,"Richmond, BC","We went for best friend's bachelorette dinner on Friday night. There was going to be 7 of us and we were shown to a large long table which seated 6 of us comfortably with 2 spots for us to put our bags. Our 1 friend had gone into labour and obviously couldn't join us. When our server found out he asked if he could take away part of the table since there was 6 of us. We said of course and he removed half the table and told us we would have to move closer to each other. The table he put 6 of us at was a table for 4 and the only way we actually fit was because we were 6 Asian girls with 3 of them not weighing more than 100lbs. We didn't know he was taking half the table away. We thought part of the table meant at the end - 2 spots. We were wrong. We could barely move sitting so close next to each other. So we brought this up to him. He said ""this is our largest table for 6"". We replied that we wouldn't even be able to fit the food on the table. His reply was that he didn't plan to bring all the food out all at once. We asked him if he would seat 6 large Caucasian men at this table and he repeated ""this is a table for 6"". We clearly weren't getting anywhere with him. He kept arguing with us so we asked to speak to the manager. We explained the situation with the manager and he did not say anything about us being at a table for 6 but he said he would try to find a larger table. He came back and ended up moving back the table the server removed. How hard was that? It wasted 30 mins of everyone's time! In the end, the 6 of us ordered $600 of food and drinks but the server never came back to check on us (go figure). We had to ask for him twice. The only reason I'm giving it any stars is because the food was decent. We enjoyed the oshi as per usual and the prime rib was excellent.",6/12/2017,2 star rating

1477,Sasa G.,"Greater Vancouver, BC","$38 Dine Out Vancouver 2015Zen (a selection of Aburi specialty items served in our traditional Japanese hinoki wood box)Aburi Maguro Sashimi (seared big eye tuna, tuna tartare, wasabi-masatake sauce) 2.5/5 - fresh tuna.  It came with 2 slices of tuna sashimi.  Jidori Chicken Nanban (sweet and sour soy, housemade tartar sauce, basil-citrus slaw) 2/5 - the chicken was warm and not crispy at all.  They probably had been sitting in the chicken for a while.  The housemade tartar did not taste any different from those from a supermarket (maybe a little bit more dill).  The basil-citrus slaw had a good amount of sourness.  It was not too watery.  There could be more.Pan-Seared Alaskan Scallop (Yukon potato puree, puttanesca) 3/5 - The puttanesca was too salty.  Scallop was decent with bland potato puree.   The puree did not taste that bland when you mixed it in with the puttanesca.Saikyo Miso Sablefish (yuzu-miso reduction, kale gomae, yuzu foam) 3.5/5 - best of the night but it was also warm.  The kale gomae was much better than a spinach gomae.  The yuzu foam was more of a presentation than the flavor.Miku Signature Sushi (selection of aburi, nigiri, roll, and oshi sushi prepared using our famous aburi-style technique) 2.5/5 - very disappointed.  There was only 6 pieces of sushi.  The rice was too soft, especially those in the oshi sushi (boxed sushi).  I think they compressed them too much.  The sashimi was fresh.  More vinegar was needed.Manjari Chocolate-Orange-Cream (caramel crisp, orange reduction, vanilla ice-cream) 2/5 - citrus in dessert is not my cup of tea.  There was an orange powder on top of a piece of orange chocolate crisp.  I could not taste much of the caramel.  Regular vanilla ice-cream. Service 3/5 - People were standing outside the door when we got there.  We waited 10 minutes.  Our server took our order and food arrived in 10 minutes max.  I understand that most people were ordering the same food and I guess they were made ahead of them.  This might be why the rice was so soft.  Our server came and checked on us after entrée and asked if we want to order extras.  I think about 50% of the people ordered extra.  This meant there was not enough food provided.   In this case, I would rather the restaurant did not offer Dine Out (or having its own dine out by charging more but comes with enough food).  We were done in less than 1.5 hours and everything seemed like it was from a factory.  I was very disappointed with the quality and service that I experienced during Dine Out.",1/19/2015,2 star rating

1485,Samantha H.,"Kirkland, United States","Holy moly this was some good sushi. Being from Seattle, we're not foreign to fresh seafood and this place did not disappoint. We got stuck in terrible traffic/weather coming over the border and missed our reservation. We came in hopes that they would still fit us in arriving 40 minutes late. Unfortunately i had reserved a table by the window to enjoy the scenery and we had to be seated in the lounge, but that was our fault on timing and the ambience was still nice. Perhaps a tad louder than I expected but you can tell the place is very popular and there were people waiting for tables still when we left after 9! Our server (wish I caught his name, I think he said Daniel?) was super friendly, knowledgeable on the menu and open to making quality recommendations. We started with drinks and ordered the Coal Harbour Platter to share as an app. I liked the oysters and clams best. Good variety though and all tasted fresh and were plated nicely. We also ordered one of the signature salmon pressed rolls, a red wave roll abd one other that the name now escapes me. One thing i really liked was that a different server brought our food and she explained exactly what was being served in great detail - I am a total sucker for product knowledge anywhere in the service industry and they were on point. Seriously, all three rolls were very different from one another and SO GOOD. I think the red wave was my favorite, but all 3 the fish just melted in your mouth (and made me feel a little less guilty for spending $16/roll). If we are back in the area again and looking for sushi i would definitely return if it was a special occasion - definitely pricier than we'd go for a normal dinner out. Lastly, it must have been a manager (bald head, beard) that came and took our payment and made some really pleasant conversation with us (again, eases the blow as you drop $100+ for sushi dinner for 2) and he asked how we planned to spend our weekend in town, recommended a place for dessert. Excellent service and really pleasant staff!!",3/21/2015,4 star rating

Though the latter was on point thanks in part to the great weather, the food (and thr star of the show for me) sadly didn't meet my expectations. The Salmon Aburi was sadly the only highlight and the Miku Zen box that day was for the most part uninspiring - a green salad woth some shrimp, flambé tuna, ebi fritter, and lamb shank with potato purée. No complaints about the  Miku Zen sushi selection though. The Coal Harbour Platter was fun to pick at but the sauces lacked flair for the most part.

We also got the ebi fritters, chicken nanban, and kaisen soba. Fritters were a bit too oily for me, but still tasty. Didn't try the chicken. The seafood in the soba dish was fresh and well prepared, but the noodle itself was quite average. Finally, the green tea opera was a bit disappointing for me.

1522,Alex C.,"Vancouver, BC","My ""go to""  place to being out of town guests to experience Vancouver sushi even before they moved to their current location (formerly Aqua Riva). They have a good view,  atmosphere and service.   Best deal is to have the Miku Zen at lunch since you get to try warm dishes and their aburi sushi which is what they're known for.   The chirashi tart is also excellent.   If you are there for dinner I would recommend ordering a chef's choice sashimi bowl.",7/11/2015,5 star rating

It's ok, since I came all the way from New York, I wanted to try what a decent Japanese restaurnt has to offer. Overall food was ok, took to long to finish the course.

1532,Masaki F.,"Calgary, AB","This place serve great aburi sushi as well as some flavored vegies sushi. I had two visits and tried several dishes. Most of them are so delicious. I recommend you share dishes with everyone. Lilke Chirashi tart or miku roles special was good but it is big enough for one person to get bored in the end of meal as it is quite a bit of chunk.We tried some desert. It is ordinary. I would rather try something else since it's a shushi restaurant, not cafe or desert place.",12/22/2015,5 star rating
1533,Craig F.,"Vancouver, BC","A high end Japanese fusion (izakaya type) establishment. It's trendy and expensive, and the food is good. If you want to go on a night out with some friends, or as a couple, this would be a definitely place to consider if you don't mind spending a bit. Like all fusion type food, it's interesting. Some fusion is done poorly and some well. This is done well, and shows the chef(s) understand what they are trying to achieve and not just mashing things together for the sake of doing so.The dishes are not large, so you will need to order a bunch of dishes if you want to actually enjoy your experience; hence the price. Add a glass of wine or sake and you'll be over $100 per person before you know it.",4/1/2016,4 star rating
1534,Cindy G.,"East Side, Vancouver, BC","I've loved the food at Miku for years, and have referred so many people to this restaurant.  Recently I stopped in by myself for an early dinner before an event.  It was just after 5 pm, not a busy time and plenty of seating available.  I said I would be ok at the sushi bar for my quick meal.  They put me in the worst possible seat in the house.  At the liquor bar, with a big coffee grinder machine right in front of my face.  I could barely see or speak with my server behind this monstrosity!  Several other single diners came in and we were all placed in this ridiculous location.  Like it was somehow embarrassing that customers might dine alone??  If the restaurant had been full and this the only option for people without a reservation it might have been acceptable.  But this was not the case.  The food was delicious as always but I don't think I'll be back at Miku.  Lots of other options in our city.",11/1/2018,2 star rating
1535,Ken W.,"New York, United States","Glam atmosphere, but the food is disappointing.  It's like sushi made by someone who has seen pictures of sushi but never eaten it.  The rice doesn't taste like sushi rice and the fish is okay, but in Vancouver where there is such fabulous fish, it's disappointing.  Which might explain why we need all the weird sauces on our sushi.  Will not return.",1/11/2015,2 star rating
1536,Jess I.,"Vancouver, BC","Food is mediocre here. The seafood has recently been not so.. Fresh? I've eaten here a handful of times and I must say every time I come back, I get more disappointed.

1542,Christina R.,"Mississauga, ON","i've been to Miku and it's sister restaurant Minami, and I have to say hands down Minami is better.  Miku is like it's cheaper, greasier sister.  The service was slow and the sushi wasn't worth the pricetag.  Though I will  give them the benefit of the doubt and go by for dine out in the Summer as I hear it is good.",5/7/2015,4 star rating
1543,K. R.,"Newport Beach, United States",Really fresh delicious sushi. Good sake selection and excellent recommendations. Only thing I was disappointed in with was the lack of sauces.

1550,Tim L.,"Markham, ON","My girlfriend and I were very excited to try this restaurant, since there were multiple good reviews.  When we got seated, the ambience and setting was very classy and modern.  We were originally planning to both try the six course meal, but because of my girlfriend's allergy to shellfish, they tried their best to accommodate us.  They suggested to us to try their four course meal, which did not disappoint us at all.  Our first course was excellent with her dish tailored to exclude shellfish, which was great because the taste was not compromised.  Our second course consisted of the prime rib for myself and sablefish for her.  Both dishes were just stellar and cooked perfectly.  Our sushi dishes came next and again we were blown away by their aburi salmon Oshi Sushi. Not to say that their other sushi dishes were not delicious, but the aburi is certainly a standout.  Our dessert with our meal was good, but we ordered the green tea opera cake.  One word. Wow.  This is something you have to try if you come here.Also wanted to shout-out to our waiter Curtis who made everything as seamless as possible.  Thank you.",8/14/2015,5 star rating

1554,A P.,"San Anselmo, United States","First time in Vancouver and first meal in the city. We nailed it by happening upon Miku. The view, cocktails and service are all fantastic (we sat at the bar--while the view from here is technically just of the bartenders, they are quite skillful and pleasant). And the food! Aburi style? Yes, please! Pressed nigiri? More, please! We eat at lots of sushi restaurants, and Miku ranks in our top 2 of all time.",7/27/2015,5 star rating
1555,Olga K.,"North Vancouver, BC","This place is fantastic. The food was absolutely delicious with complex flavours in each dish I tried. I thought this was pretty much impossible when it comes to sushi, but the Chef has certainly proved me wrong. What's more, the Pastry Chef has completely overwhelmed me with unbelievable presentation of the desserts that were just as flavourful as the main fare. Definitely NOT the desserts I would expect at a sushi bar. Miku needs to hold on to their Pastry Chef (it turns out he's European).Very, very impressed, and Miku is the number 1 on my list of favourite restos in Vancouver.Sadly, I have missed their dine-out experience  this year, but will make it a point to attend in the coming years.

1567,R K.,"Las Vegas, United States",Bleh.  Pretty dining room and bar with a beautiful view.  Service was great.  Food was mediocre.   We sat down and they immediately told us that this was not traditional Japanese.  We should've left at that point. The sashimi was excellent and beautifully presented.  The salmon was incredible.  Possibly the best I've ever had.  Deep rich orange.  I suppose what you would expect in Vancouver.   We pretty much let the server bring what was most popular.  The rolls were not good.  Weird combination of flavors.  Their sushi comes in a rectangular box shape.  It almost looks like a Lego.  It looks fake.  The rice makes up 80% of the piece and the thin slice of fish sits on top.  They don't serve their sushi with wasabi.  You have to ask for it.   Their gimmick is giving you two types of soy sauce.  A darker one and lighter one.  We came in a group of 9 and nobody cared for the food.  Bummer as this was our first meal in Vancouver and we were all craving sushi.,7/5/2014,2 star rating

1572,Milo T.,"Burnaby, BC","We celebrated our parents anniversary dinner here thinking it would be a quiet high end restaurant given the location and price point. Unfortunately it was extremely loud and casual and many people were wearing shorts and tank tops. I've realized that Miku probably caters to tourists. My father was excited to try the uni and the sake flight but like a previous reviewer said, they were both unavailable. We all opted for the tasting menu and while presentation is nice, we left hungry. The time between courses were quite long but that could be due to the restaurant being busy. Overall experience was underwhelming and I feel that we could get better Japanese for a lower price. Yes, the view is very nice but the whole experience was not spectacular.",9/4/2017,3 star rating

It's really expensive but they have their own signature sushi here I think it's the Salmon Oshi sushi that I've had twice topped with a little bit of jalapeño and it's so delicious. I also like that they have a lot of gluten free options including gluten free soya sauce and a few dessert options as well. Service is pretty good here too. I came here once for a friend's work party and another time with another.

The crowd looks a little pretentious though so if you are not into that, maybe not the place for you. It is also not a fancy quiet restaurant. It was louder than i expected.

Most of what our table tasted, from edamame (overcooked and under salted) to signature rolls and aburi (nothing special) was underwhelming, though I was very happy with the veggie lunch with the garden roll and tofu steak. The service was well intentioned but was very clumsy (i.e. a beer that was ordered but never arrived, having to ask for miso soups that should have come with dishes we ordered, spoons that we asked for but never arrived and being charged for an extra green tea).I'm sure there is good sushi in Vancouver but go find it elsewhere, or just come here for a drink and an appetizer to admire the view.",3/30/2015,2 star rating

1596,Adrian H.,"Vancouver, BC","I had lunch today at Miku for the first time. It seemed to be all about presentation and not about food quality. For example, the miso soup was worse than it is from an inexpensive Japanese restaurant in Vancouver. Watery, poorly seasoned. Do they even make their own miso? We ordered a set menu including a number of warm items ( oyster tempura, sou vide chicken breast, sable fish, etc and aburi sushi. The sable fish was completely overcooked. The chicken breast had almost no flavour (skin removed, inadequate seasoning, barely warm). The aburi sushi looked great, but is so much worse than sashimi. Perhaps the ala carte menu would have been better. Overall, a disappointing experience.",7/22/2017,1 star rating

1598,Katherine P.,"Manhattan, United States",Great food and drinks. Atmosphere was a bit odd in that the lights are basically off at dusk (poor lighting = depressing lighting). The Fairmont Pacific Rim was doing the same thing in their lobby - so maybe this is a Vancouver thing? Our bar tenders were professional and quick. Restaurant was also louder than one would want in a fine dining locale.,8/25/2014,4 star rating
1599,Shuchi M.,"New York, United States","Whoever said you can't get good food in Vancouver hasn't visited this establishment yet. Sit at the sushi bar so you can see the chefs at work, and order all the aburi oshi sushi on the menu. And then thank me for it! Fresh, with layers of flavor, fun presentations and smiling service, I think I also learnt a thing or two about sushi while peering over the bar.

1603,Kathleen C.,"Surrey, BC","Went here for a special date night with my boyfriend. We love sushi so we thought we'd give a ""fancier"" sushi place a try. I couldn't even focus on the food because of how BAD the service was for us:1. I made reservations a month ahead and requested a seat by a window (hoping to face out to the water). We got there and it was pretty busy, so we didn't mind waiting a little bit for a good spot! We got a terrible table, its like they forgot about the reservation, pulled out a random table from nowhere, and placed it in the middle of the restaurant. It was very chaotic and disappointing. You would think a month would be enough time to get a good spot.. 2. After being pretty upset about our table, we got the most awkward greeting from our server, he wasn't friendly, or welcoming, or very helpful at all with our menu. My boyfriend and I don't eat very much so we didn't order a lot and our server gave us a vibe that he thought ""oh that's it?"".. And awkwardly walked away. We weren't being cheap! We just can't eat a lot!3. The food got to us fairly quickly considering how busy this place was. Our server kept having conversations, was checking up on, and was considerably nicer to the older couple beside us (we look very young), he didn't ask us ONCE how our food was.. In fact, he didn't acknowledge us at all. Just because we look younger, doesn't mean we don't deserve good service..4. the only good thing I can say about this place was the bus boy was really nice and polite to us and even offered us the dessert menu when he was cleaning up after us (I think that was our server's job). He deserves the one star I gave to this restaurant.Will not be coming back to this restaurant.",8/2/2015,1 star rating

1605,Mei M.,"Vancouver, BC","The aburi salmon is REALLY fantastic. I often come back with a friend just for this as it's the best in Vancouver we've tried so far. Also tried a few of their rolls as well as their calamari, and was tasty, but really just average. The prices don't seem too bad on the menu but you end up having to order quite a bit more just because the sizes of their rolls in particular are quite small.

1606,Jules S.,"Vancouver, BC","Came here a while back when they were still serving their Omakase dinner with 3 other people. We had to order the Omakase dinners ahead of time which created much anticipation amongst us. Everything tasted good but to our disappointment it was nothing special for all the fuse. The dinner consisted mostly of items on the regular menu so we didn't understand why we had to order the dinners ahead of time. Also we were still hungry after all the items were served so we added a couple more items.We didn't feel it was good value for what we got hence the 3 stars. If it was just based on taste and service, I would give it a 4 stars.I prefer their sister restaurant, Minami in Yaletown.",11/7/2014,3 star rating

1608,Jorge C.,"Chicago, United States","We really wanted to like this place and were excited to eat here when we saw the high ratings. The location is great and the views are very nice- no complaints about the restaurant itself. The service was good, attentive and there was plenty of staff so no complaints there either. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. We knew what the prices were going in so we have no complaints about the costs. The sushi was boring- I can't think of another word to use. It was quality fish but their big presentation gimmick is flame-searing the sushi. That would be great if it had any added flavor but it did very little for the sushi. The pressed sushi we ordered did not look or taste like it was made to order.  You are not given any wasabi and use of soy sauce was discouraged. I've had sushi in some of the best restaurants in the world and some of the quickest cheapest places. You should get what you pay for and if a place is going to say they are one of the best in the world and charge fine dining prices, there has to be more flavor differentiation from one item to the next.",6/24/2018,3 star rating
1609,WenHao X.,"Burnaby, BC","This is my probably the fifth time been there, different feeling every time. About this time, the service attitude was not that good, me and my friends were wait there at the table for more than 20 mins for cups of water. Maybe that because we were there just an hour and a half before the their close hour. Otherwise, the dishes are still good.",1/8/2015,4 star rating
1610,Ashley L.,"Vancouver, BC","I had family come from out of town, and I wanted to bring them to Miku as I hear so many good things about it. Knowing that it's a very popular restaurant, I booked almost a month in advance for a table for 6 at 7:30pm. I arrived at 7:30 exactly and they informed us that the table is not ready yet. They said that the table was just finishing up and we would get the table in 10min. So we sat down and waited. 5 minutes in, I see the manager bring in other people that came in after us that were similar party sizes. I gave the the benefit the doubt that perhaps they had also had reservations and so did not make a big fuss about the situation. After waiting for 20 minutes, they still could not tell us when we will be able to be seated. What's the point in making reservations then? We were so disappointed at the way the establishment handled the incident that we left.",10/23/2016,1 star rating
1611,Ava J.,"Vancouver, BC","This is definitely the place to be, its fancy and the food is so good. Pretty pricey though compare to other sushi joints in Vancouver but your paying for the presentation and the location. They are famous for their salmon aburi - sushi - i forgot what they call it but its the sushi they have on their profile picture. You must try it, its so good. I always have a good time here, the sake is delicious too, i always go for the house one. I cant really taste the difference between the house one compare to other more expensive choices yet. This place is definitely 5 star. Will recommend Miku to everyone.",9/11/2015,5 star rating

1624,Meg W.,"North Vancouver, BC","I've been to Miku a few times and I have to admit I've never been able to peel myself away from ordering the Miku Zen (I've only been at lunch) - for $28, it's a ridiculous deal for a vast variety of food - I'm the person who prefers to order a bunch of appetizers rather than one plate so I can try more, so it's right up my alley.We happened to go during Dine Out, not knowing that Miku was doing Dine Out at lunch, so the Zen lunch was basically the same as the Dine Out menu but with the addition of dessert (sorbet).  The rotation changes occasionally, and this time it included miso soup (always), aburi tuna with masatake sauce, beer battered prawn with sweet chili and soy sauce, green salad with miso tofu, veg, crispy topping and soy vinagrette (my favourite, so simple but so refreshing) and the soy braised beef shank with potato puree (which I pawned off on my lunch date as I don't eat beef).  All delicious, as always.  The fat kid in me would have easily done another round.Oh and that's the appetizer.  Next comes a ""selection of aburi, nigiri and oshi sushi"", which included tuna, ebi, hamachi, something else I don't remember and of course a piece of the famous aburi salmon oshi sushi.  Divine as always.Our server was excellent, and even tried to get the kitchen to sub out the beef for me (I would have been happy for another portion of the salad or...well....anything), but they refused.  I appreciated that she tried.  She was very sweet and just the right amount of attentive.  The only sour point of the whole experience was that I showed up early for the reservation, and when I spoke to one hostess (and expressed that I was early for my reservation, as in, I was aware that my table wouldn't be ready), another cut in and cut me off to tell me that the table wouldn't be ready until promptly 1pm (our reservation time).  It was biting cold outside and I had to park blocks away, so I thought I would be better off waiting inside the restaurant, and was happy to wait (as I said I *knew* I was early), so I was a little put off at her need to jump in and basically tell me off for being early.  The irony being that not only did they end up taking me to the table prior to 1pm, but there were a plethora of empty tables within immediate sight-line from the front door when I first got there.  Anyway, I'll chalk it up to a one-off, but I wasn't impressed.  Luckily our server made the rest of the visit worth 5 stars.",1/22/2014,5 star rating

1628,Winifred X.,"Seattle, United States","A local coworker recommended this place, quote him ""the best sushi I've ever had""... well, maybe that set my expectations really high, but it's still pretty good. So this earns a 4 star in my book of great sushi places. Decor - this place definitely caters to the shi-shi crowd, similar to Yaletown, which is no surprise when I learned that they have a sister restaurant there called ""Minami"" using the same Kanji character as this one though. The view is probably what drives the crowd here, in addition to really well designed modern interior decorations. It's indeed a pleasure to dine here, along with those eye pleasing plates and the amount of effort they put into the absolutely gorgeous food presentation. Food:- excellent miso soup that came with our lunch entree order, has seaweed, enoki mushrooms, and fresh green scallion in with the miso base. Beautiful bowl, and very large portion. - Ebi Fritter ($14) is gorgeous, with 6 very large prawns dipped in batter fried to a very crispy texture. Excellent!  Much more complexity than the avg shrimp cocktail dish.- Sashimi Lunch ($25) -- the most fabulous presentation, though the amount of food is actually just your standard 9 piece, (so don't be tricked to think you won't be able to finish it all). Very fresh pieces, though they say ""chef's choice"" on the menu, this is a pretty standard spread of your every day sashimi pieces, nothing exotic, but very high quality and fresh pieces. The scallop is my favourite. - Aburi Chirashi Tart ($21) -- ""Aburi"" style being their specialty, it's basically fish minced and layered with the rice, pressed into a shape (round or box) to form a beautiful looking pie piece..  Again, great ingredients. One thing worth noting is that they use good quality soy sauce, does not give you too much so it doesn''t overwhelm the fresh taste of the fish. And the FRESH WASABI, I have learned since a long time ago and fresh wasabi to powder mixture is like fresh pasta to the dollar packets you get at the supermarket... They are NOT the same thing, and only high end Japanese restaurants go through the pain and cost of procuring fresh wasabi roots to be ground to order. Their Wasabi was delicious, not too overpowering, yet still has that kick, and it's not green food colouring!  =)Overall, definitely a place to take your date to, or your family visiting in town, day time scene is better than night looking out the window, definitely ask for window seats!Oh, forgot to mention that I didn't see the Nigiri to order on the menu, apparently you can still order the, and the dinner menu has them. Actually, the dinner Chef's selection is probably the real Omakase @ market price. And ""Miku Zen"" ($28) is a 4 bowl presentation, I will have to try that next time. As well as ""Red Wave"" and other flame seared roll selections.",12/8/2013,4 star rating

1650,Cyrus L.,"North York, ON","While traveling, we had a 7 hour layover in Vancouver. Excited to get a meal in before hopping on the plane again we decided to have that one precious meal at Miku. The location came with referrals from local friends and Yelp reviews looked solid, so we decided to give this establishment a try.We got to the location at 11:15am, 15 minutes before open on a Sunday. When I asked the hostess if we could be seated early and wait because of the chill, she reminded me that the restaurant opened at 11:30am.We noticed that the staff were having their morning meeting, so to be polite, we decided to wait outside in the cold. Within 10 minutes we realized that people who arrived after us were waiting inside a waiting area. To condense the long story, at least 4 tables without reservation were seated before us. It would have been really nice for the hostess to take my name and invite us to wait inside instead of watching us wait outside in the cold with all our luggage in hand.When the restaurant opened we waited inside with our luggage still in hand.  A couple who arrived later than us was offered to have their bags stored for their convenience while they waited.  Oddly enough though the hostess didn't notice us and strolled past our group of three people and three pieces of carry on.  With a rough start just to get a table, we were seated at a bar table after waiting half an hour with others being seated before us by large windows with a view. The hostess noticed our frustration but decided not to do anything about it.  Instead, we were seated in the bar area. Again, odd treatment especially when none of this was requested.  We were on a layover, had just come from the airport but were not inappropriately dressed.  Being known for being quite big ""food critics"" among our peers we were quite excited to try this place but were extremely disappointed by their lack of service and customer experience.The food was excellent, but nothing above the prices.I do not recommend this place unless service is not important to your dining experience.",11/22/2015,1 star rating

1652,Lily D.,"Phoenix, United States","From all the raving I've heard about this place, I decided to give it a try. Brought my sister and sister-in-law out to this place, spent over $200 I must say this place deserves a 4 stars because of their fresh and yummy sashimi. Their sushi and specialty ""torch"" dishes were nothing to crave about. The drinks were below average. We only finished a third of our drinks from the bar. The service were awesome and the ambiance were upbeat along with the easy to find location that is convenient to tourists like ourselves. It's a good place for a nice change with fresh air.",5/25/2016,4 star rating
1653,Lucy L.,"Vancouver, BC","Miku is the sister restaurant of Minami and they have a very similar menu. The Salmon Oshi Sushi is to die for, melts instantly in mouth. All the Aburi's are worth trying. Basically order anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed. Miku has very professional waiter/waitresses to explain different items on the menu for you, so don't be worried if you aren't a sushi expert! Miku moved locations since the last time I've been. Right now, it is situated at Coal harbour across from the Pan Pacific Hotel and The Fairmont Pacific Rim. Very good location however lost that dimmed/chill/sophisticated ambiance that it once had. This new location is more casual however a lot of people definitely still dress up for the special occasion. Overall, I love Miku/Minami and would definitely recommend it to any friend/family. A must try and a gem in Vancouver! A magic touch to the japanese cuisine!",10/26/2014,4 star rating
1654,M D.,"Vancouver, BC","came here saturday for our anniversary hoping for great views, great food, great service. i guess 2 outta 3 is ok but losing the ambience really ruined the experience for me. we tried to make a reservation earlier in the week but they were all booked up but we really wanted to have a special experience so we decided it would be worth the wait. we arrived at 845 and were quoted 30 minutes (a lot shorter than i had anticipated) left our number and went for a drink, 45 min later  no call yet so we came back and decided to just wait. we were seated just after 10pm at what has to be the worst table possible i was actually kind of shocked it existed. RIGHT behind the hostess stand in a huge window out to the florescently light stairwell entrance where people were crowded smoking. honestly i'm still kicking myself for not asking for a different table but it was 10:15 and i just didn't want to risk another wait. service was great and the food was amazing, but we spent $300 for two people and got none of the ambience or intimacy i had hoped for in specifically picking this as a special spot for our 5 year anniversary. we couldn't have eaten like this at home but it would have been a lot more romantic than the experience we had.",1/30/2017,3 star rating

1657,Diana T.,"Vancouver, BC","We decided to give Miku a try after having recently reopened at their new location at Waterfront, conveniently located right beside Waterfront SkyTrain station.Calamari - $14 (7/7)This isn't your typical calamari! This is THE calamari. It's not all batter, and the batter actually stays ON the squid without flaking off or leaving any batter residue at the bottom of your plate. The squid itself is the most moist and soft we've had. It's not chewy, and it melts in your mouth! Garnished with pickled beets and cucumber.Cast Iron Baked Mussels - $21 (7/7)This also isn't your typical order of mussels. It's not accompanied by a broth / sauce, however, it comes with some sort of butter for you to dip your magical, heavenly mussels in. The bacon is oh-so smokey and delicious. PERFECTLY complements the mussels. Probably the best dried (dried because it isn't swimming in a broth / sauce) mussels in town.Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi - $15 (5/7)You can't go to Miku without ordering their signature aburi dishes. We opted for the salmon one, and to be honest, it was pretty amazing, BUT it just tastes like any other salmon nigiri. Miku salmon aburi enthusiasts - please forgive us. Note - this took an HOUR to come out. Yes, one (1) hour.Pacific Roll - $15 (4.5/7)This was kind of .. weird? It's definitely creative, that's for sure. You can SLIGHTLY taste the minty-ness from the leaf, if you tried hard enough. Couldn't really taste the avocado, and the roll had a mushy consistency. This also took an hour. Had we been starved and disappointed with their other dishes, this would probably have been a disastrous meal. Their saving grace was the calamari and mussels.Miku, when they were at their old location, had much better food. This wasn't as good, despite their pretty amazing calamari and mussels.",8/29/2013,4 star rating
1658,Agata S.,"Crawfordsville, United States","So far, the best dining experience I've had in downtown Vancouver. Though a little pricey, the seafood was fresh and mouth-watering. And let me tell you about the dessert: their green tea opera is worth every penny (actually more like $12). The aromatic ice cream, the crunchy-creamy cake, and the peppercorn sugar decoration provided delightful bursts of flavor. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Vancouver.",1/15/2015,5 star rating

1667,Rick D.,"Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, United States","Thanks to Yelp my wife and I ate dinner at Miku for our first meal in Vancouver. Great spot, very busy, interesting decor and great sushi. Due to the large crowd and our lack of a reservation we had to wait about 20 minutes and were seated at the bar which was the first seating available. The bartender and menu guide, Jennifer, was extremely well versed on the menu, the variety of sushi preparations and offered excellent input as to the offerings. Miku has a interesting twist with regards to one preparation for sushi which is very lightly seared, this provides an interesting twist on traditional sushi with a mildly smokey flavor. Miku serves their own take on sushi rolls as well as more traditional nigiri and sashimi. All the fish was very fresh, the service was top notch and the flavor combinations of the different items that we ordered we wonderful. I would highly recommend, great food, great service, great location and interesting people watching. Get there early and be ready to wait, you can leave your phone number and walk the neighborhood as they will call you when your table or seating is ready.",9/2/2016,5 star rating
1668,Ms K.,"Burnaby, BC","I just wrote a highly negative review for another jap resto tairyou ichiba, so I wanted to write a positive review to balance out my Yelp ""chi"" for the day haha. I love Miku. I come here often, especially for birthdays. I was here for my NYE dinner too. I usually am seated in the VIP room because that's how I roll. Haha jk! It's really because my friends book the VIP room for birthdays, etc. first of all, the VIP room has a beautiful view esp at night. When it gets dark, the lights come on at the Canada place and it's beautiful how the lights reflect off the water. Second, the food is excellent. I've tried pretty much everything from their pressed sushi to their sablefish and steak and I don't think I hated anything. Their service is amazing and servers are friendly and accommodating. I just can't 5 star them because they are quite expensive, their drinks can sometimes be off, and parking is awful. Fairmont across the street offers valet parking but it costs $18 and more with tip and I just find it so $$$. Their drinks are expensive and I noticed they have a tendency to make their cocktails very sweet. Last time I had a Mohito and would've liked a bit more minty and less sweet. Our bill last time between me and my man was about $400+. Def not cheap. Overall I love this place for the food and service. I don't love their prices and parking. I still find myself returning quite often lol.",3/27/2016,4 star rating

It helps that we get a better exchange rate via the US dollar.  But every dish is artfully prepared and all tasted great.  All the sushi were very fresh.  We were stuffed when we left.  Definitely not your run of the mill Japanese restaurant.  So for those looking for a different (aka top of the line Japanese dining experience)  this is the place to go.  We made a reservation for friday night and that's the only way to get in as the restaurant was very popular and many people were turned away without reservation. You might want to try the bar if there are open seats.   They mentioned they are a chain from Japan and also have other branches in Vancouver.  SO definitely will try out these other branches next time we are in town.   For the price and quality, five stars!",8/5/2016,5 star rating

One plate comes with 8 pieces, so two plates could be a full meal if you are not too hungry.For the drinks, the Shiso Mojito is my favorite.

1685,Vaness K.,"New Westminster, BC","The Northwest Fusion restaurant masquerading as ""Japanese"". If I want Japanese proper, I have 3 restaurants (ramen, sushi, curry) on standby. Plus side, I know what I'm getting into with Miku. Reservations made (you need them), I headed out. Expect a noisy restaurant because all the yuppies trying to impress their friends go to it.Miku is fusion with Japanese ingredients thrown in. They make their own wasabi. There is a variety of pickled items. I did the Kaiseki - Kaisen, the 6 course option so I could give them a try with a variety of their items... and not just their layered sushi.Of the courses, most have fish, except the 4th (beef) and the dessert (which will always be their green tea cake specialty). If you hate fish, go away. Fish most commonly featured included: salmon and tuna (two varieties), and a mix of other fish and seafood. All of it was seasoned with the exception of the sashimi (basically cuts of fish), and they offered a variety of soy sauces as well as condiments to play up what was on offer. Probably what I found most interesting what would they did with the vegetables and sauces. Opening course was my favorite since it did play to the Japanese idea of the seasons, combining ingredients to make a symphony of flavors (which included uses of vegetables). After that, it was the one nigiri sushi with the fatty tuna on it, since it's a pain to find that anywhere. They do keep it pretty safe though, with the exception of the giant prawn, which they then offer to deep fry its head for you to snack on later. No squids, no eels, no urchin.It's good. It's worth a try. You might learn something. There were Japanese fruits and vegetables that are hard to come by, and fun to pick out the flavor of from the rest of the food. If you're here to stuff your mouth with sushi, go somewhere else. You probably won't care enough to notice the difference. If you want ""Japanese"" food, Miku is too westernized, but doesn't mean it doesn't taste or look good. Maybe it's a little pretentious and the food less authentic, and doesn't justify the weird hype it gets.",9/26/2016,4 star rating

Not only was the food delicious, the presentation was top notch. We really enjoyed the Oshi Sushi (both salmon and prawn versions) and the lobster tail. However, the standout both in flavor and presentation was the Sashimi Lunch special. I also appreciated that the person who brought the food to the table took the time to explain each item. And it was fun to catch a view of the chefs at work in the kitchen. We found there was a on both visits. The first time we waited for a table (which was ready in about half the time predicted), and the second time, we were seated immediately at the bar, which is a centerpiece to the main room.

1712,Cassandra B.,"Delta, BC","This place is phenomenal, and I just want to start out with that. I know Vancouver is known for it's cheap and decent sushi places but at Miku you really get the experience that you pay for. All of the menu items come out so fresh and the service staff explains each dish so eloquently (from pre-order to table arrival) that you feel like you made the right choice regardless of being adventurous or sticking with safe favourties. The extensive cocktail and wine lists allow for a unique lounge feel, which paired with the new waterfront location is hard to compete with in the Asian cuisine scene. From personal experience I recommend Obaachan's Yuzu (Japanese fruit wine) and the Miku roll. It is a bit more on the pricey side but what you get as far as atmosphere, quality and service are concerned it is definite value.",5/16/2014,5 star rating

1714,Ellie T.,"Vancouver, BC","Went here for lunch with my friends on an absolutely beautiful day. The view was incredible!Seated promptly once I arrived (my friends made a reservation and had already arrived) - noticed the place was very nice and clean looking. Ordered 5 sushi dishes and a plate of the gyoza. Food arrived fairly quickly and we were given a brief description of each dish.As someone who's had a lot of sushi, I have to say that the Aburi Oshi selections were DELICIOUS. Highly recommend the salmon one (the other one we had was the mackerel). The other ones we had were the coal harbour, Miku, and king (my favourite from the three) (I think ... it was a week or two ago so I don't quite remember now). The gyoza (which wasn't spicy, thankfully) was also good.This place is pretty pricey, though. We only got a couple of pieces each and paid about $20 each ... I don't think any of us were full after.All in all I'd definitely come here again, but I'd probably get a lunch box, or wait until I'm no longer a poor university student ...",5/10/2014,4 star rating

1717,Ashley M.,"Downtown, Boston, United States","Amazing! I found this place because of its stellar Yelp reviews and the yelpers were correct this time! I sat at the bar and ordered the Pimms cocktail. It was nice but a bit sweet. I just wanted to a Pimms on account of being in British Colombia. At the recommendation of the bartenders, I ordered the Kaisu Seaweed Salad and the Miku Signature Selection. It was some of the best sushi I've ever had. First, the Kaisu Seaweed Salad had 3 different kinds of seaweed, finely sliced baby cucumbers, radishes, spring greens, and my favorite...LOTUS ROOT. I was a lovely dish and probably representative of the flavors that make Vancouver such a wonderful food city. The Signature Selection had 3 different styles of sushi: traditional and aburi nigiri, specialty rolls, and oshi. Aburi oshi sushi is their signature and it is out of this world. I particularly enjoyed the salmon and mackerel versions. Based on my experience, you cannot go wrong with what you order here, since I tried a sampler. The atmosphere was upbeat. The staff seemed to have high morale. Whenever a table is sat, all the staff greet them loudly in unison. The staff is knowledgeable and take pride in their restaurant. Go here!!!",6/2/2016,5 star rating
1718,Jess L.,"Calgary, AB",Literally the BEST sushi I have ever had in Canada. The pressed sushi just melts in your mouth. It's not the cheapest sushi place in Vancouver but definitely worth it because the quality is just amazing. I only heard about this place from a bunch of people but it definitely lived up to the hype. I wish I could have gone another time when I was there but reservations get pretty full if you don't book early,3/23/2016,5 star rating
1719,Flo C.,"Vancouver, BC",My husband and I came here for a wedding anniversary lunch. This place sure didn't disappoint. Impeccable service and beautifully presented food. We ordered a medley of chef's tasters which was perfectly portioned and the flavours were very well balanced. The sushi was immaculate. Absolutely delicious. Can't wait to further explore the menu.,12/1/2015,5 star rating
1720,Kathy S.,"Woodstock, United States","Excellent! The Soba Pepperoncino was fantastic. Difficult to locate based upon the address, but well worth the effort to find. Sushi was also very good and worth paying a little more than the average for a roll.",6/30/2013,5 star rating
1721,Haley P.,"Edwards, United States","We celebrated my husbands birthday here at the new location which has beautiful ocean views and comfy outdoor lounge seating vie had the cast iron mussels, hamachi sashimi, pacific roll, aburi salmon, and red wave roll. Also enjoyed tasty drinks and excellent service. Always a great dining experience.",8/31/2013,5 star rating

1724,Carol L.,"Vancouver, BC",It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Vancouver.  Service is good and food is consistently amazing.  It's my go to place to bring out of town guests and they always love it - especially the aburi!,2/20/2016,5 star rating
1725,Kenny L.,"Mississauga, ON","Definitely standard has dropped at this new location.  Will not go out of our way to come back. We ordered 2 omagase, and additional Ala carte sashimi Like toro, Saba ...coal harbour roll, sake. Bill was close to $400. Not worth it as the omagase selection was pretty lame! Green salad? All the sushi rice falls apart when picked up, not even biting into it yet! A big no, no according to Jiro, rice is the most important, not the fish!  Overall, our lead server was attentive, not too communicative which suits us fine. Quality  of food is lame, no wow effect, not memorable and definitely not a good dining experience this time. The toppings on the sushi is not refine, too overpowering, too much ginger actually....heavy handed! What happen to Vancouver standard of eating?",7/29/2014,2 star rating
1726,Sheila P.,"Vancouver, BC","I came here with my company for lunch and it was a fantastic experience. It was my first time at Miku (or Minami, its sister restaurant), and the server was very patient to explain everything to me, including their popular dishes and the concept of the restaurant dishes (i.e. no soy sauce, each dish has a signature sauce, etc.)I ordered the Aburi lunch dish that came with 8 pieces of sushi. At first I was wondering if 8 pieces of sushi would even be enough, but it was super filling. The sauce was amazing, and paired wonderfully with each piece of sushi. The ingredients are all super fresh and intricately prepared.Only downside is the price, which is pretty high for the quantity you get. The 8 piece Aburi lunch was $20.I think I like this place enough that I'll be back, but it will probably be for special occasions only because the price is too high to go regularly.",10/26/2013,5 star rating
1727,Spencer C.,"Richmond, BC","I came here for my birthday last year. Their service was very nice, and we were sat at a window which gave us a nice view of the docks. I ordered the salmon aburi sushi (which wasn't as good as all the other times I've had it at Minami - they are the same company) and it was cold. I did however, love the calamari here compared to Minami. It was a good experience but I definitely prefer to go to Minami, the atmosphere is more personal feeling.",10/26/2015,3 star rating
1728,NJ C.,"New Haven, United States","2nd time in Vancouver and some of the best sushi I have ever had. We ate what the waiter told us to and were amazed at every last bite. All of the staff seemed to know the menu extremely well, and at times their food knowledge came of slightly snobbish. Nevertheless, this is some of the best sushi I have ever had since I was in Tokyo.",10/21/2015,5 star rating
1729,Emily B.,"Watertown, United States","My husband frequently comes to Vancouver for work, but this is my first time here. He's been talking about Miku for over a year and I finally tried it last night. It certainly did not disappoint! We sat at the sushi bar (which I love, because it's fun to watch everything being put together). Our waiter was fantastic, and even though the restaurant was packed, we didn't wait for anything. Drinks were served almost immediately after being seated, and plates of sushi were brought out just minutes after each order we placed. Everything was so fresh and delicious! The menu is labeled to indicate which items can be prepared gluten free, and the waiter was very knowledgeable about what went into everything, which made ordering very easy. Can't wait to come back!",7/30/2015,5 star rating
1730,Jennie H.,"Vancouver, BC","I really enjoyed the ambiance and food at Miku. The interior was very modern and simple. I liked how you can still tell its a Japanese restaurant despite the Western influences. The service was unique as well. With each dish served, the server would explain all the ingredients that went into it. Our waitress would come frequently enough to check up on us as well. I think that ordering the pressed sushi is your best bet because it's the most unique items on the menu. As an avid sushi fan, I was impressed with the quality and taste of all the rolls we ordered. Just a warning, there is a $1.75 cake serving charge if you do plan on bringing your own cake there. However, Miku actually cuts the cake for us (unlike other places where you do it yourself), which made the serving charge worth it.Overall, I would definitely recommend Miku if you want upscale Japanese cuisine.",1/19/2014,4 star rating

1739,Hallie Y.,"Chicago, United States","The hostesses did not seem to have a good grasp of seating situation when we walked in. We were told to wait 30 minutes when the bars were wide open and there were several open tables. However, the service was prompt and professional. The sake selection was impressive, the decor of the restaurant was great and the food was tasty. The green tea opera dessert was extremely impressive. Loved the torched/pressed salmon roll and the o toro nigiri. Would definitely go back.",9/4/2015,5 star rating

1747,John Z.,"Nashville, United States","Miku is the best sushi I have ever consumed. The salmon and ebi oshi is flame seared sushi and so succulent it could be a dessert.

1752,John C.,"Toronto, ON",I've been several times and have to admit it is the best sushi I've had.  The aburi style is phenomenal (melts in your mouth).  The green tea is really good too.  Really nice location near the waterfront and has a patio if you want to sit outside (and blankets if it's a bit chilly).   The only negative is that it can get a bit loud inside if it's packed but will make a point to return next time I'm in town.,4/25/2015,5 star rating
1753,Tony K.,"Vancouver, BC","Delicious food, excellent service. Pricey compared to other sushi restaurants, but the presentation is worth it.

1758,T W.,"Highlands, United States","Honestly, I think this place is overrated and overpriced. First of all, their waiters have obviously been trained in up selling. They pretend as though they care about your feedback when it is quite obvious they really don't. Their white wine by the glass selections were horrid. I tried two and both were very lack luster. As far as the food goes, the Ebi Fritter appetizer was great. The Sunrise roll was good as well. Their feature roll of the night - inclusive of yellowtail tuna, was only ok. As far as the ""signature"" dish was concerned aka Salmon Oshi Sushi - EWWWW. You take some of the freshest and best wild salmon in the world and you pollute it with this ""signature"" concept. To be honest the smoked salmon aka lox I had at the concierge lounge at the Marriott was better than this dish. It just diluted the essence of salmon and seems to be under serving the fish that is probably the singularly unique attribute of this location. Oh - and by the way - I was obviously not considered prime clientele because I was dining alone. Despite an early and pre-booked 6:15 reservation via Open Table I was given a table overlooking a parking garage. Serious thumbs down Miku. Quite a disappointment.",12/2/2015,2 star rating
1759,C C.,"Vancouver, BC",My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and it was amazing! The salmon and Saba aburi were both excellent. I've never had better anywhere else.  The kale gomae is definitely worth a try. The hamachi carpaccio was so buttery it practically melts in your mouth. Every dish was delicious. I highly recommend this place.,3/31/2014,5 star rating
1760,Vinnie S.,"Beltsville, United States","This place got me hooked on Sushi! I am from Washington DC and this place got me hooked on Sushi! If you are new and would like a variety I highly recommend the Miku Signature Selection for 35 dollars.  You get a little of everything, and everything is good! All the sushi is really good buy my favourite is the Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi and Aburi Saba Oshi Sushi.  These are what Miku is known for.  You can not go wrong! My co-worker hates seafood...He will not eat it, but even he like those.  I also tried the Miku Omakase which is the 100 dollar, 72 hour in advance special.  The food was really good but it takes like 2-3 hours to eat. It was good, but I would have honestly rather have had 3 signature selections.",1/31/2014,5 star rating

1763,Yelin L.,"Manhattan, United States","We were in Vancouver for a wedding and had only 2 nights free for checking out all the food spots for dinner. I picked Miku because of the high ratings on yelp and proximity to my hotel. I made the reservation on opentable in advance and told them we are bringing a baby. When we got there, they don't have the table ready, we had to wait for a good 15 mins before getting seated and the high chair didn't buckle up. We waited for another 5 mins to hunt down a waitress to switch the high chair. The restaurant doesn't seem to be managed well and we have different waitress coming to our table for different food we ordered. We tried the torched sushi and some cooked dishes like the soba and grilled chicken. Food was ok but I don't think its a 4.5 rating equivalent. There are also big flies around our table which made me worry about the food hygiene. it feels like more of a see and to be seen trendy restaurant than for serious foodies.",7/17/2015,3 star rating
